(Vietnamese: Chăm Pa) was a collection of independent Cham polities that extended across the coast of what is today central and southern Vietnam from approximately the 2nd century AD before being absorbed and annexed by Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mạng in AD 1832.[1] The kingdom was known variously as nagara Campa (Sanskrit: नगरः चम्पः; Khmer: ចាម្ប៉ា) in the Chamic and Cambodian inscriptions, Chăm Pa in Vietnamese (Chiêm Thành in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary) and 占城 (Zhànchéng) in Chinese records. The Chams of modern Vietnam and Cambodia are the remnants of this former kingdom. They speak Chamic languages, a subfamily of Malayo-Polynesian closely related to the Malayic and Bali–Sasak languages. Champa was preceded in the region by a kingdom called Linyi (林邑, Lim Ip in Middle Chinese), or Lâm Ấp (Vietnamese), that was in existence since AD 192; although the historical relationship between Linyi and Champa is not clear. Champa reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Thereafter, it began a gradual decline under pressure from Đại Việt, the Vietnamese polity centered in the region of modern Hanoi. In 1832, the Vietnamese emperor Minh Mạng annexed the remaining Cham territories. Hinduism, adopted through conflicts and conquest of territory from neighboring Funan in the 4th century AD, shaped the art and culture of the Champa kingdom for centuries, as testified by the many Cham Hindu statues and red brick temples that dotted the landscape in Cham lands. Mỹ Sơn, a former religious center, and Hội An, one of Champa's main port cities, are now World Heritage Sites. Today, many Cham people adhere to Islam, a conversion which began in the 10th century, with the Royals having fully adopted the faith by the 17th century; they are called Bani Cham (from Arabic: Bani). There are, however, Balamon Cham (from Sanskrit: Brahman) who still retain and preserve their Hindu faith, rituals, and festivals. The Balamon Cham are one of only two surviving non-Indic indigenous Hindu peoples in the world, with a culture dating back thousands of years. The other is the Balinese Hinduism of the Balinese of Indonesia.","privateMemo":"Polygon2_Champa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-70.1944808959961,-25.23194122314453,0],[-70.29402923583984,-24.812877655029297,0],[-70.31576538085938,-24.43812370300293,0],[-70.24917602539062,-24.329984664916992,0],[-70.25908660888672,-23.917078018188477,0],[-70.15579986572266,-23.6436824798584,0],[-70.21158599853516,-23.51040267944336,0],[-70.3759765625,-23.472627639770508,0],[-70.34906005859375,-23.326461791992188,0],[-70.36957550048828,-23.148622512817383,0],[-70.2694091796875,-23.059471130371094,0],[-70.08834838867188,-22.97015380859375,0],[-70.02656555175781,-22.77943229675293,0],[-70.03028106689453,-22.410978317260742,0],[-69.99747899646988,-22.200488839211555,0],[-69.98868560791016,-22.144062042236328,0],[-69.90696716308594,-21.73096466064453,0],[-69.90878295898438,-20.676380157470703,0],[-69.9861831665039,-19.742656707763672,0],[-70.00485229492188,-19.05022621154785,0],[-70.09235382080078,-18.612056732177734,0],[-70.15990447998047,-18.438011169433594,0],[-70.2502670288086,-18.2058048248291,0],[-70.38046264648438,-18.066308975219727,0],[-71.0203857421875,-17.78814697265625,0],[-71.16153717041016,-17.680448532104492,0],[-71.26649475097656,-17.37572479248047,0],[-71.408203125,-17.204483032226562,0],[-69.67080518211256,-14.360175054246211,0],[-69.45005327061386,-14.08821102324696,0],[-68.80613834609485,-14.168700388811835,0],[-67.73861443610576,-15.411025023725347,0],[-67.03392628582996,-18.34722564987449,0],[-67.62116641105979,-22.45790652648329,0],[-67.74882935109564,-24.62817650709271,0],[-67.98813023850381,-25.475069505416748,0],[-68.89057227990138,-25.531472133004094,0],[-70.1944808959961,-25.23194122314453,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Tiwanaku empire","color":"#b769b7","image":"300px-Puma_Punku14.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The Tiwanaku state (Spanish: Tiahuanaco or Tiahuanacu) was a Pre-Columbian polity in western Bolivia based in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day Peru and Chile and lasted from around AD 550 to 1000. Its capital was the monumental city of Tiwanaku, located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73).[2] One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later Inca Empire, but supporting evidence is weak.\n\nTiwanaku was a multi-cultural \"hospitality state\"[3] that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of llama caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800.[2]\n\nOutside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \"soft power\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony.","privateMemo":"Polygon3_TiahuanacoEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0],[80.54473876953125,5.986286640167236,0],[80.42581939697266,6.074979305267334,0],[80.33132934570312,6.2336320877075195,0],[80.2204360961914,6.512971878051758,0],[80.05775451660156,7.078125476837158,0],[80.04238891601562,7.370365619659424,0],[80.04439544677734,7.713481426239014,0],[80.03583526611328,8.12012004852295,0],[79.92784118652344,8.433548927307129,0],[80.01236724853516,8.66446304321289,0],[79.8782958984375,8.82190227508545,0],[79.90945434570312,8.947855949401855,0],[80.09967803955078,8.937359809875488,0],[80.25627899169922,9.13085651397705,0],[80.28018951416016,9.29610538482666,0],[80.3817367553711,9.462162017822266,0],[80.31324768066406,9.703569412231445,0],[80.55126190185547,9.487302780151367,0],[80.86608123779297,9.316428184509277,0],[80.9712905883789,9.138753890991211,0],[81.21858215332031,8.789820671081543,0],[81.29710388183594,8.643853187561035,0],[81.25273895263672,8.491267204284668,0],[81.26374053955078,8.427757263183594,0],[81.52980041503906,8.275839805603027,0],[81.6496353149414,7.94569206237793,0],[82.0085220336914,7.330141544342041,0],[82.06983184814453,7.10153341293335,0],[81.98268127441406,6.770936965942383,0],[81.80358123779297,6.46555233001709,0],[81.63754272460938,6.287286281585693,0],[81.4063491821289,6.096163272857666,0],[81.05546569824219,5.968320846557617,0],[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Simhala","color":"#48a7c1","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"known as Hela) are an Indo-Aryan-speaking ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka.[14] They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million.[1][2] The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion.

More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class.[27] Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. They say the invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. The sculptures inside palatial structures, such as Xalla, were shattered.[28] No traces of foreign invasion are visible at the site.[27]\n\nEvidence for population decline beginning around the 6th century lends some support to the internal unrest hypothesis. The decline of Teotihuacan has been correlated to lengthy droughts related to the climate changes of 535–536. This theory of ecological decline is supported by archaeological remains that show a rise in the percentage of juvenile skeletons with evidence of malnutrition during the 6th century. Which is why there is different evidence that helps indicate that famine is most likely one of the more possible reasons for the decline of Teotihuacan. The majority of their food came from agriculture, they grew things such as maize, bean, amaranth, green tomatoes(tomatillos?), and pumpkin. But their harvest was not nearly sufficient to feed a population as big as it is believed lived in Teotihuacan.[29] This finding does not conflict with either of the above theories, since both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine.[30] Other nearby centers such as Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla competed to fill the power void left by Teotihuacan's decline. They may have aligned themselves against Teotihuacan to reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites emulate Teotihuacan forms, but also demonstrate an eclectic mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.[citation needed]\n\nThe sudden destruction of Teotihuacan was common for Mesoamerican city-states of the Classic and Epi-Classic period. Many Maya states suffered similar fates in the coming centuries, a series of events often referred to as the Classic Maya collapse. Nearby in the Morelos valley, Xochicalco was sacked and burned in 900 and Tula met a similar fate around 1150.[31]\n\nThere is a theory[32] that the collapse of Teotihuacan was caused by its agriculture being devastated by the 535 CE eruption of the Ilopango volcano in El Salvador.","privateMemo":"Polygon5_Teotihuac�n","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-99.00720527910974,17.72748619284094,0],[-98.38318647471972,18.004827883680946,0],[-96.85780717509968,18.074163306390943,0],[-96.00226001887197,17.9030538751454,0],[-95.9842242778941,17.896753319011513,0],[-95.22842474141464,17.45014450200093,0],[-95.29776016412464,16.54878400677091,0],[-96.23378837070968,16.236774604575903,0],[-97.4818259794897,16.410113161350907,0],[-98.81216621498947,16.840630772072725,0],[-98.97253756775474,17.31147365658093,0],[-99.00720527910974,17.72748619284094,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Monte Albán","color":"#00ff00","image":"275px-Mexico.Oax.MonteAlban.Panorama.02.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Monte Albán is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán Municipality in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca (17.043° N, 96.767°W). The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the Valley of Oaxaca where the latter's northern Etla, eastern Tlacolula, and southern Zimatlán & Ocotlán (or Valle Grande) branches meet. The present-day state capital Oaxaca City is located approximately 9 km (6 mi) east of Monte Albán. The partially excavated civic-ceremonial center of the Monte Albán site is situated atop an artificially-leveled ridge, which with an elevation of about 1,940 m (6,400 ft) above mean sea level rises some 400 m (1,300 ft) from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks.[1] The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well. Besides being one of the earliest cities of Mesoamerica, Monte Albán's importance stems also from its role as the pre-eminent Zapotec socio-political and economic center for close to a thousand years. Founded toward the end of the Middle Formative period at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative (ca.100 BC-AD 200) Monte Albán had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist polity that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states such as Teotihuacan to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reutilization of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.","privateMemo":"Polygon6_MonteAlb�n","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-90.73114776611328,19.39847755432129,0],[-90.69257354736328,19.77048683166504,0],[-90.46878051757812,19.963647842407227,0],[-90.51111602783203,20.17827033996582,0],[-90.46945190429688,20.6933650970459,0],[-90.35514068603516,21.008146286010742,0],[-90.07386779785156,21.15838050842285,0],[-90,21.177701950073242,0],[-89.65916442871094,21.266847610473633,0],[-89.34379577636719,21.312023162841797,0],[-88.85442352294922,21.414764404296875,0],[-88.39739990234375,21.581016540527344,0],[-88.13005828857422,21.607013702392578,0],[-87.90572357177734,21.582059860229492,0],[-87.39327239990234,21.50050926208496,0],[-87.16726684570312,21.587627410888672,0],[-86.99691009521484,21.54584503173828,0],[-86.71792602539062,21.317598342895508,0],[-86.69657135009766,21.18415069580078,0],[-86.73223114013672,20.993371963500977,0],[-86.86629486083984,20.821456909179688,0],[-87.1096420288086,20.59845733642578,0],[-87.30448150634766,20.40719985961914,0],[-87.44705200195312,20.20688247680664,0],[-87.45606231689453,19.892108917236328,0],[-87.5703125,19.758384704589844,0],[-87.65454864501953,19.59928321838379,0],[-87.58491516113281,19.529508590698242,0],[-87.43342590332031,19.59163475036621,0],[-87.47854614257812,19.298320770263672,0],[-87.59669494628906,18.760334014892578,0],[-87.64582824707031,18.505956649780273,0],[-87.67343139648438,18.397836685180664,0],[-87.82646942138672,18.638256072998047,0],[-87.9013442993164,18.841520309448242,0],[-87.93401336669922,18.9113712310791,0],[-88.10774230957031,18.758441925048828,0],[-88.1167984008789,18.511371612548828,0],[-88.195556640625,18.326000213623047,0],[-87.92005157470703,18.404062271118164,0],[-87.90827178955078,18.210901260375977,0],[-88.09671020507812,17.652406692504883,0],[-88.01681518554688,17.53126335144043,0],[-88.12334442138672,17.173555374145508,0],[-88.03822326660156,17.030475616455078,0],[-88.07976531982422,16.85162353515625,0],[-88.24087524414062,16.458148956298828,0],[-88.37610626220703,16.300758361816406,0],[-88.53816223144531,16.28645133972168,0],[-88.56248474121094,16.157676696777344,0],[-88.73715209960938,16.050365447998047,0],[-88.73711395263672,15.921590805053711,0],[-88.60061645507812,15.878668785095215,0],[-88.46067810058594,15.742738723754883,0],[-88.3977279663086,15.82858943939209,0],[-88.4276351928711,16.000288009643555,0],[-88.2764892578125,15.929433822631836,0],[-88.07026672363281,15.764202117919922,0],[-87.9298095703125,15.777620315551758,0],[-87.65447998046875,15.898987770080566,0],[-87.36695098876953,15.925020217895508,0],[-88.039264345806,14.852809219537047,0],[-89.90135440055302,13.769951911649652,0],[-89.9319076538086,13.789677619934082,0],[-90,13.81475830078125,0],[-90.41744995117188,13.968528747558594,0],[-90.69361114501953,13.95422077178955,0],[-91.03836822509766,13.968528747558594,0],[-91.31204986572266,14.07583999633789,0],[-91.72102355957031,14.371105194091797,0],[-91.95173645019531,14.559768676757812,0],[-92.2684097290039,14.809314727783203,0],[-92.69686126708984,15.208847045898438,0],[-93.12682342529297,15.55117130279541,0],[-93.38419366047071,15.758031782465252,0],[-92.94035579198459,16.99946425438592,0],[-92.73427416823088,18.603149033813345,0],[-92.25542449951172,18.70589256286621,0],[-91.89421844482422,18.776588439941406,0],[-91.90335845947266,18.5328311920166,0],[-91.52607727050781,18.432676315307617,0],[-91.4073257446289,18.561504364013672,0],[-91.27533721923828,18.650766372680664,0],[-91.32195281982422,18.76176643371582,0],[-91.49881744384766,18.840456008911133,0],[-91.01603698730469,19.119468688964844,0],[-90.73114776611328,19.39847755432129,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Maya states","color":"#61b44c","image":"250px-Chichen_Itza_3.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period.[34] Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began.

The find was the first to show an extensive settlement related to the Wari culture that far north and demonstrate that they had a long span of influence.","privateMemo":"Polygon10_HuariEmpire\nWari Empire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[34.72699234432423,12.51934718281175,0],[35.35498172108183,13.068837887474649,0],[35.66987098354391,14.296999568072307,0],[35.53133440665001,15.439926327446965,0],[35.52434512329068,15.55102718595111,0],[38.959891112918186,17.81322846683603,0],[39.107521014039975,17.381046823950662,0],[39.16644493054672,17.208549011193103,0],[39.21249008178711,17.073753356933594,0],[39.41160583496094,16.343481063842773,0],[39.72159194946289,15.480020523071289,0],[40.0001106262207,15.105743408203125,0],[40.09220504760742,15.20124626159668,0],[40.05985641479492,15.417208671569824,0],[40.10154724121094,15.51895809173584,0],[40.240875244140625,15.404888153076172,0],[40.42111587524414,15.100289344787598,0],[40.59354782104492,14.922759056091309,0],[40.83419418334961,14.942323684692383,0],[40.94280242919922,14.9362154006958,0],[41.54491424560547,14.359295845031738,0],[41.90892028808594,13.947072982788086,0],[41.964752197265625,13.902724266052246,0],[42.28264236450195,13.877985954284668,0],[42.56074523925781,13.484644889831543,0],[42.57008361816406,13.376649856567383,0],[42.55862808227539,13.287668228149414,0],[42.61210632324219,13.192468643188477,0],[42.84010314941406,13.11035442352295,0],[43.251686096191406,12.71928596496582,0],[43.534141540527344,12.451045989990234,0],[43.66234588623047,12.241631507873535,0],[43.67848587036133,12.114594459533691,0],[43.62559509277344,12.063642501831055,0],[43.46280288696289,11.980687141418457,0],[43.26551055908203,11.93579387664795,0],[43.01362228393555,11.79545783996582,0],[42.758995056152344,11.585225105285645,0],[42.8724365234375,11.528285026550293,0],[43.162811279296875,11.554329872131348,0],[43.30723571777344,11.548284530639648,0],[41.730545745273204,10.296853529130573,0],[37.202971293311215,9.372858743015879,0],[35.539780678304766,9.557657700238817,0],[35.07778328524742,9.834856136073224,0],[35.07778328524742,11.960044144137019,0],[34.72699234432423,12.51934718281175,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Axum","color":"#69fae0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Axum was the centre of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Kingdom, which predated the earliest mentions in Roman-era writings. Around 356 CE, its ruler was converted to Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Sasanian Empire which had adopted Zoroastrianism. The historical record is unclear, with ancient church records the primary contemporary sources. It is believed it began a long and slow decline after the seventh century due partly to the Persians and then the Arabs contesting old Red Sea trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Kingdom of Aksum was finally destroyed by Empress Gudit[citation needed], and eventually some of the people of Aksum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the kingdom's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) king to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the kingdom's influence and power ended long before that. Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the Ethiopian Empire south to the Agaw region as it moved further inland. The city of Axum was the administrative seat of an empire spanning one million square miles. Eventually, the alternative name (Ethiopia) was adopted by the central region, and subsequently, the present modern state.","privateMemo":"Polygon11_Axum","show":true}},{"Position":[[[35.470779274411804,16.402503866889464,0],[35.52434512329068,15.55102718595111,0],[35.53133440665001,15.439926327446965,0],[35.66987098354391,14.296999568072307,0],[35.35498172108183,13.068837887474649,0],[34.72699234432423,12.51934718281175,0],[34.615785892190075,12.422041537194362,0],[34.06138902052126,12.237242579971426,0],[33.50699214885245,12.237242579971426,0],[32.213399448291874,12.329642058582895,0],[31.484898377845447,13.07356462666072,0],[30.73500779050837,13.992832673589339,0],[30.73500779050837,15.840822245818725,0],[35.470779274411804,16.402503866889464,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Alwa","color":"#97e1a7","image":"260px-Soba_East,Granitsäulen.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρογα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, 'Alwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now Central and Southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers.\n\nFounded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it controlled much of central and southern Sudan. It exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Alodia, a large, multicultural state, was administrated by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\",[3] prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished.\n\nFrom the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.","privateMemo":"Polygon12_Alwa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[30.73500779050837,15.840822245818725,0],[30.55020883328543,16.949615989156356,0],[29.81101300439368,18.797605561385737,0],[30.019330227383314,20.130835788519388,0],[34.62544157065165,20.523021659811228,0],[35.35498172108183,18.243208689716923,0],[35.470779274411804,16.402503866889464,0],[30.73500779050837,15.840822245818725,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Makkura","color":"#a6d35c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Makkura","privateMemo":"Polygon13_Makkura","show":true}},{"Position":[[[30.019330227383314,20.130835788519388,0],[30.273010397451024,21.754388876952753,0],[31.012206226342776,23.879576885016547,0],[31.843801533845998,23.78717740640507,0],[32.952595277183626,23.78717740640507,0],[33.86089446131677,24.034960615677313,0],[33.96898954190979,22.493584705844505,0],[34.615785892190075,20.553195655003655,0],[34.62544157065165,20.523021659811228,0],[30.019330227383314,20.130835788519388,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Nobatia","color":"#f2b5d1","image":"250px-Blok_fryzu_z_absydy_I_Katedry,_warsztat_nubijsk.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Nobatia /noʊˈbeɪʃə/ or Nobadia (/noʊˈbeɪdiə/; Greek: Νοβαδἰα, Nobadia; Old Nubian: ⲙⲓⲅⲓⲧⲛ︦ ⲅⲟⲩⲗ, Migitin Goul) was a late antique kingdom in Lower Nubia.

In 543 it converted to Coptic Christianity, just to get annexed by Makuria under unknown circumstances somewhere during the 7th century.","privateMemo":"Polygon14_Nobatia","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-8.440399169921875,42.43672180175781,0],[-8.601381301879883,42.648529052734375,0],[-8.738059997558594,42.84116744995117,0],[-8.969459533691406,42.87287521362305,0],[-9.043195724487305,42.917747497558594,0],[-9.067139625549316,43.0656623840332,0],[-8.993803024291992,43.17518615722656,0],[-8.80992603302002,43.297828674316406,0],[-8.645552635192871,43.34321594238281,0],[-8.392058372497559,43.356590270996094,0],[-8.106749534606934,43.37002182006836,0],[-8.047033309936523,43.4473991394043,0],[-8.016560554504395,43.63418197631836,0],[-7.775865077972412,43.75702667236328,0],[-7.432610988616943,43.73838424682617,0],[-6.947638511657715,43.57191467285156,0],[-6.604311943054199,43.5403938293457,0],[-6.263909816741943,43.57969665527344,0],[-6.004382610321045,43.657493591308594,0],[-5.775992393493652,43.72235107421875,0],[-5.616787433624268,43.722660064697266,0],[-5.333754062652588,43.594425201416016,0],[-5.021232604980469,43.52421951293945,0],[-4.598671913146973,43.48641586303711,0],[-3.906552314758301,43.468482971191406,0],[-3.64394211769104,43.45613479614258,0],[-3.213336706161499,43.39262390136719,0],[-2.9923014640808105,43.4638557434082,0],[-2.803541898727417,43.56724548339844,0],[-2.5646986961364746,43.554847717285156,0],[-2.1637206077575684,43.34321594238281,0],[-1.939259555652397,43.348443011640455,0],[-1.86198091506958,43.350242614746094,0],[-1.7109140157699585,43.3223876953125,0],[-1.542406439781189,43.377132415771484,0],[-1.3577439785003662,43.54139709472656,0],[1.7215715065070363,42.544271564533325,0],[2.0911694209529124,42.544271564533325,0],[2.7379657712331955,43.283467393425084,0],[3.4771616001249512,43.74546478648243,0],[4.011132717132568,43.48419952392578,0],[3.6823766231536865,43.32906723022461,0],[3.521531820297241,43.21292495727539,0],[3.27156400680542,42.9615364074707,0],[3.205554962158203,42.78778076171875,0],[3.2495627403259277,42.556427001953125,0],[3.290745258331299,42.385616302490234,0],[3.290192127227783,42.34608459472656,0],[3.289949893951416,42.1376953125,0],[3.360217571258545,42.09269332885742,0],[3.332542657852173,41.87419891357422,0],[2.831923007965088,41.636512756347656,0],[2.4042539596557617,41.46311950683594,0],[2.284388542175293,41.315460205078125,0],[2.269151501318303,41.31256962240362,0],[1.8134924173355103,41.22612762451172,0],[1.6457593122426102,41.196970602202235,0],[1.5149086713790894,41.174224853515625,0],[1.0828657150268555,41.0387077331543,0],[0.937415599822998,40.89192581176758,0],[0.9134458303451538,40.802120208740234,0],[1.0307892560958862,40.7443962097168,0],[0.991220235824585,40.673858642578125,0],[0.7088053822517395,40.6097297668457,0],[0.44159138202667236,40.257171630859375,0],[0.043038755655288696,39.90299606323242,0],[0,39.816410064697266,0],[-0.08085206896066666,39.653743743896484,0],[-0.1911846399307251,39.45143127441406,0],[-1.3276112876714485,39.21789033452043,0],[-2.6212039882320184,37.73949867673693,0],[-5.577987303799031,37.92429763395987,0],[-6.501982089913724,38.29389554840574,0],[-8.645055741846342,37.833739869215975,0],[-8.647364616394043,37.927154541015625,0],[-8.729122161865234,37.97881317138672,0],[-8.619329452514648,38.223045349121094,0],[-8.64363956451416,38.40153884887695,0],[-8.585256576538086,38.45295333862305,0],[-8.649988174438477,38.5166130065918,0],[-8.818658828735352,38.47799301147461,0],[-9.032906532287598,38.43442153930664,0],[-9.081494331359863,38.63644027709961,0],[-8.86548900604248,38.65993118286133,0],[-8.738228797912598,38.758888244628906,0],[-8.757163047790527,38.83543395996094,0],[-8.837185859680176,38.93715286254883,0],[-8.972090721130371,38.749202728271484,0],[-9.157973289489746,38.68811798095703,0],[-9.318733215332031,38.7069091796875,0],[-9.345343589782715,38.79148864746094,0],[-9.256098747253418,38.97005081176758,0],[-9.194043159484863,39.24733352661133,0],[-9.2116060256958,39.38364791870117,0],[-9.095605850219727,39.43470764160156,0],[-8.91425895690918,39.661006927490234,0],[-8.711921691894531,40.155120849609375,0],[-8.766005516052246,40.20698928833008,0],[-8.490406036376953,41.0091438293457,0],[-8.648114204406738,41.424800872802734,0],[-8.651090621948242,41.61382293701172,0],[-8.717071533203125,41.783992767333984,0],[-8.602391242980957,41.906150817871094,0],[-8.656822204589844,42.0315055847168,0],[-8.5949068069458,42.21150207519531,0],[-8.440399169921875,42.43672180175781,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Visigothic Kingdom","color":"#876e48","image":"140px-Leovigild_CNG_97-722237_(obverse).jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Visigothic Kingdom or Kingdom of the Visigoths (Latin: Regnum Gothorum) was a kingdom that occupied what is now southwestern France and the Iberian Peninsula from the 5th to the 8th centuries. One of the Germanic successor states to the Western Roman Empire, it was originally created by the settlement of the Visigoths under King Wallia in the province of Aquitaine in southwest France by the Roman government and then extended by conquest over all of the Iberian Peninsula. The Kingdom maintained independence from the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire, the attempts of which to re-establish Roman authority in Iberia were only partially successful and short-lived. The Visigoths were considered the most civilized among the barbarians, and considered themselves \"heirs of the Roman Empire\"; the Goths were the first people to invade Rome and to defeat a Roman emperor in battle. The Visigoths became Foederati of Rome, and wanted to restore the Roman order against the hordes of Vandals, Alans and Suevi. The Roman Empire fell in 476 A.D.; therefore, the Visigoths believed they had the right to take the territories that Rome had promised in Hispania in exchange for restoring the Roman order.[5]\n\nSometimes referred to as the regnum Tolosanum or Kingdom of Toulouse after its capital Toulouse in modern historiography, the kingdom lost much of its territory in Gaul to the Franks in the early 6th century, save the narrow coastal strip of Septimania, but the Visigoth control of Iberia was secured by the end of that century with the submission of the Suebi. The kingdom of the 6th and 7th centuries is sometimes called the regnum Toletanum after the new capital of Toledo.\n\nThe ethnic distinction between the indigenous Hispano-Roman population and the Visigoths had largely disappeared by this time (the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).[6] The Visigothic Code (completed in 654) abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans and for Visigoths. Most of the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by Umayyad troops from North Africa in 711 AD, with only the northern reaches of Spain remaining in Christian hands. These gave birth to the medieval Kingdom of Asturias when a local landlord called Pelayo, most likely of Gothic origin, was elected Princeps by the Astures.\n\nThe Visigoths and their early kings were Arians and came into conflict with the Catholic Church, but after they converted to Nicene Christianity, the Church exerted an enormous influence on secular affairs through the Councils of Toledo. The Visigoths also developed the highly influential law code known in Western Europe as the Visigothic Code (Liber Iudiciorum), which would become the basis for Spanish law throughout the Middle Ages.","privateMemo":"Polygon15_VisigothicKingdom\n西ゴート王国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-1.3577439785003662,43.54139709472656,0],[-1.110715389251709,44.57593536376953,0],[-0.9321861267089844,44.61707305908203,0],[-1.0266567468643188,44.74738311767578,0],[-1.1281142234802246,44.63079833984375,0],[-1.071850299835205,45.14570236206055,0],[-0.9715279340744019,45.51747512817383,0],[-0.9197765588760376,45.44858932495117,0],[-0.696700394153595,45.310882568359375,0],[-0.6105628609657288,45.13881301879883,0],[-0.5248222351074219,45.035614013671875,0],[-0.6510385870933533,45.33842086791992,0],[-0.934731125831604,45.600135803222656,0],[-1.0437313318252563,45.70512008666992,0],[-1.0328418016433716,45.8170166015625,0],[-0.8715358972549438,46.03158950805664,0],[-0.962317705154419,46.200653076171875,0],[-1.052392840385437,46.32380294799805,0],[-1.1990046501159668,46.42090606689453,0],[-1.5070626735687256,46.465763092041016,0],[-1.738814353942871,46.72277069091797,0],[-1.9259965419769287,46.86781692504883,0],[-1.8009817600250244,47.05947494506836,0],[-1.9058138132095337,47.141014099121094,0],[-2.0600860118865967,47.19985580444336,0],[-2.290048122406006,47.263893127441406,0],[-2.3728201389312744,47.34183883666992,0],[-2.2618796825408936,47.511356353759766,0],[-2.4099884033203125,47.5892219543457,0],[-2.58687162399292,48.60655212402344,0],[-2.4327142238616943,48.568973541259766,0],[-2.139221668243408,48.69112014770508,0],[-1.9964083433151245,48.6159553527832,0],[-1.87230384349823,48.67313003540039,0],[-1.666903018951416,48.72871398925781,0],[-1.6539489030838013,48.62533950805664,0],[-1.3876930475234985,48.65447235107422,0],[-1.2529239654541016,48.700523376464844,0],[-1.3718841075897217,48.78511428833008,0],[-1.3847484588623047,48.89792251586914,0],[-1.3597447872161865,49.0532112121582,0],[-1.3761156797409058,49.2459831237793,0],[-1.4353359937667847,49.23657989501953,0],[-1.6878798007965088,49.5433235168457,0],[-1.7376203536987305,49.72627639770508,0],[-1.3205833435058594,49.669742584228516,0],[-1.047305703163147,49.71685028076172,0],[-1.0849967002868652,49.53794479370117,0],[-0.9734796285629272,49.34952163696289,0],[-0.8195272088050842,49.41543197631836,0],[-0.26128464937210083,49.368350982666016,0],[-0.03570113703608513,49.302459716796875,0],[0,49.30878448486328,0],[0.23653383553028107,49.350677490234375,0],[0.5345120429992676,49.471927642822266,0],[0.29403600096702576,49.52752685546875,0],[0.3187178373336792,49.61924743652344,0],[0.3930366337299347,49.697998046875,0],[0.7322235107421875,49.8427734375,0],[1.0724213123321533,49.92422103881836,0],[1.4781826734542847,50.02127456665039,0],[1.6198921203613281,50.12681579589844,0],[1.755652904510498,50.24578094482422,0],[1.731960654258728,50.59469985961914,0],[1.79258394241333,50.8388557434082,0],[1.9998408049252938,50.93838644742835,0],[2.02721905708313,50.951534271240234,0],[2.233991861343384,51.02362823486328,0],[2.6462597846984863,51.06500244140625,0],[2.7257957458496094,51.10809326171875,0],[4.4011563862396414,50.95262411817703,0],[5.325151172354335,50.95262411817703,0],[5.971947522634618,51.41462151123437,0],[7.819937094864006,51.3222220326229,0],[9.29832875264751,49.84383037483939,0],[10.129924060150735,49.65903141761646,0],[12.347511546825992,50.1210288106738,0],[12.901908418494813,49.75143089622793,0],[13.08670737571775,47.071846016495314,0],[12.652461361902075,47.12293378282657,0],[11.51591623932277,47.25664497371826,0],[10.68432093181955,47.25664497371826,0],[9.205929274036041,46.97944653788385,0],[8.097135530698413,45.87065279454622,0],[7.819937094864006,45.039057487042996,0],[8.251730821406209,44.03540021201174,0],[8.18319034576416,43.98188781738281,0],[7.892784118652344,43.90401840209961,0],[7.756474018096924,43.884422302246094,0],[7.671189164397154,43.82780621322823,0],[7.60078239440918,43.78106689453125,0],[7.501280307769775,43.68427276611328,0],[7.126743793487549,43.464637756347656,0],[6.726677894592285,43.167823791503906,0],[6.534888744354248,43.128841400146484,0],[6.39144229888916,43.10926055908203,0],[6.032234191894531,43.03778839111328,0],[5.850218772888184,43.050289154052734,0],[5.638154029846191,43.120628356933594,0],[5.255480766296387,43.345069885253906,0],[5.113509654998779,43.3834114074707,0],[4.954258441925049,43.37023162841797,0],[4.850177764892578,43.33783721923828,0],[4.620428562164307,43.36311721801758,0],[4.281859874725342,43.504058837890625,0],[4.011132717132568,43.48419952392578,0],[3.4771616001249512,43.74546478648243,0],[2.7379657712331955,43.283467393425084,0],[2.0911694209529124,42.544271564533325,0],[1.7215715065070363,42.544271564533325,0],[-1.3577439785003662,43.54139709472656,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Frankish

Empire was the largest post-Roman Barbarian kingdom in Western Europe. It was ruled by the Franks during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. It is the predecessor of the modern states of France and Germany. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, West Francia became the predecessor of France, and East Francia became that of Germany. Francia was among the last surviving Germanic kingdoms from the Migration Period era until its partitioning in 843.\n\nThe core Frankish territories inside the former Western Roman Empire were close to the Rhine and Maas rivers in the north. After a period where small kingdoms inter-acted with the remaining Gallo-Roman institutions to their south, a single kingdom uniting them was founded by Clovis I who was crowned King of the Franks in 496. His dynasty, the Merovingian dynasty, was eventually replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. Under the nearly continuous campaigns of Pepin of Herstal, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, Charlemagne, and Louis the Pious—father, son, grandson, great-grandson and great-great-grandson—the greatest expansion of the Frankish empire was secured by the early 9th century, by this point dubbed as the Carolingian Empire.\n\nDuring the Carolingian and Merovingian dynasties the Frankish realm was one large kingdom polity subdivided into several smaller kingdoms, often effectively independent. The geography and number of subkingdoms varied over time, but a basic split between eastern and western domains persisted. The eastern kingdom was initially called Austrasia, centred on the Rhine and Meuse, and expanding eastwards into central Europe. It evolved into a German kingdom, the Holy Roman Empire. The western kingdom Neustria was founded in Northern Roman Gaul, and as the original kingdom of the Merovingians it came over time to be referred to as Francia, now France, although in other contexts western Europe generally could still be described as \"Frankish\". In Germany there are prominent other places named after the Franks such as the region of Franconia, the city of Frankfurt, and Frankenstein Castle.","privateMemo":"Polygon16_FrankishKingdom\nフランク王国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[15.65226936340332,41.87369918823242,0],[16.216506958007812,41.921295166015625,0],[16.391075134277344,41.85783386230469,0],[16.40207862854004,41.76264190673828,0],[16.19281005859375,41.65161895751953,0],[16.07691764831543,41.51911544799805,0],[16.043490691284767,40.696281992303945,0],[15.19598388671875,40.389190673828125,0],[15.154668807983398,40.568450927734375,0],[14.946981430053711,40.72178649902344,0],[14.53779125213623,40.61057662963867,0],[14.553433418273926,40.65949630737305,0],[14.698254585266113,40.74693298339844,0],[14.573974609375,40.86844253540039,0],[14.443659782409668,40.86991500854492,0],[14.254537582397461,40.78448486328125,0],[14.14554214477539,41.01500701904297,0],[14.056164741516113,41.10792922973633,0],[14.000670433044434,41.210418701171875,0],[13.964171029170481,41.22367039932788,0],[13.702054023742676,41.3188362121582,0],[13.532771050915118,41.32806693164743,0],[14.010702161832441,42.17467365008745,0],[14.185166510252316,42.22203387901351,0],[14.633110504442204,42.34363310718263,0],[14.722972869873047,42.246673583984375,0],[14.923619270324707,42.15873336791992,0],[14.942191123962402,42.06412887573242,0],[15.126069068908691,41.98874282836914,0],[15.65226936340332,41.87369918823242,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Lombard principalities","color":"#4b9cc0","image":"240px-Wodan_Frea_Himmelsfenster_by_Emil_Doepler.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Lombards (/ˈlɒmbərdz, -bɑːrd, ˈlʌm-/)[1] or Longobards (Latin: Langobardi; Italian: Longobardi [loŋɡoˈbardi]) were a Germanic people who ruled most of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774.\n\nThe Lombard historian Paul the Deacon wrote in the Historia Langobardorum that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili,[2] who dwelt in southern Scandinavia[3] (Scadanan) before migrating to seek new lands. In the 1st century AD, they formed part of the Suebi, in north-western Germany. By the end of the 5th century, they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria and Slovakia north of the Danube river, where they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552; his successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids in 567.\n\nFollowing this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War (535–554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom there. In contrast with the Goths and the Vandals, the Lombards left Scandinavia and descended due south through Germany, Austria and Slovenia, only leaving Germanic territory a few decades before reaching Italy. The Lombards would have consequently remained a predominantly Germanic tribe by the time they invaded Italy. [4] The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians, and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all of northern Italy and the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in central Italy and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in north and central Italy, later named Regnum Italicum (\"Kingdom of Italy\"), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler Liutprand.

In the 1st century AD, they formed part of the Suebi, in north-western Germany. By the end of the 5th century, they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria and Slovakia north of the Danube river, where they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552; his successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids in 567.\n\nFollowing this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War (535–554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom there. In contrast with the Goths and the Vandals, the Lombards left Scandinavia and descended due south through Germany, Austria and Slovenia, only leaving Germanic territory a few decades before reaching Italy. The Lombards would have consequently remained a predominantly Germanic tribe by the time they invaded Italy. [4] The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians, and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all of northern Italy and the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in central Italy and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in north and central Italy, later named Regnum Italicum (\"Kingdom of Italy\"), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler Liutprand. In 774, the Kingdom was conquered by the Frankish King Charlemagne and integrated into his Empire. However, Lombard nobles continued to rule southern parts of the Italian peninsula, well into the 11th century when they were conquered by the Normans and added to their County of Sicily. In this period, the southern part of Italy still under Longobardic domination was known to the foreigners, by the name Langbarðaland (Land of the Lombards), in the Norse runestones.[5] Their legacy is

Roman Empire","color":"#ff0000","image":"140px-Heraclius_613-616.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Fatih, İstanbul, and formerly Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.[2] During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both the terms \"Byzantine Empire\" and \"Eastern Roman Empire\" are historiographical exonyms; its citizens continued to refer to their empire simply as the Roman Empire (Greek: Βασιλεία Ῥωμαίων, tr. Basileia Rhōmaiōn; Latin: Imperium Romanum),[3] or Romania (Ῥωμανία), and to themselves as \"Romans\".[4] Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West diverged. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use in place of Latin.[5] Thus, although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.[4] The borders of the empire evolved significantly over its existence, as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast, including North Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries. The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 exhausted the empire's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Early Muslim conquests of the 7th century wherein it lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arabs.[6] During the Macedonian dynasty (10th–11th centuries), the empire expanded again and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance, which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia. The empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration, and by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city.[7] However, it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms. Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 14th and 15th century. The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire.[8] The last of the imperial Byzantine successor states, the Empire of Trebizond, would be conquered by the Ottomans eight years later in the 1461 Siege of Trebizond.","privateMemo":"Polygon19_EasternRomanEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[100.88352952917964,24.148765438077767,0],[101.71828482608109,24.7052689693454,0],[102.46028953443793,25.354523089157645,0],[103.88632758199874,26.07334257486873,0],[106.63406601894519,24.890770146434615,0],[104.03704953969623,20.16049013065972,0],[103.43790868574956,20.139834719904712,0],[102.28294102561803,19.841102578315752,0],[100.90185260858942,19.4958304740586,0],[100.32639910149416,20.186374682572907,0],[100.55658050433226,20.76182818966816,0],[100.46914663293616,21.945879903357184,0],[100.327025997912,23.87051367244395,0],[100.88352952917964,24.148765438077767,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Thai Kingdoms","color":"#6c9552","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Prior to the arrival of the Thai people and culture into what is now Thailand, the region hosted a number of indigenous Austroasiatic-speaking and Malayo-Sumbawan-speaking civilisations.

The name was still used in the 13th century by the Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan, author of The Customs of Cambodia.[1] It appears on the Mao Kun map. However, modern historiography applies the name exclusively to the period from the late 6th to the early ninth century.[2] It is dubious if \"Chenla\" ever existed as a unitary kingdom or if this is a misconception by Chinese chronists. Most modern historians assert that \"Chenla\" was in fact just a series of loose and temporary confederations of principalities.[3]\n\nAlthough most of the Chinese recordings on Chenla, including that of Chenla conquering Funan (\"derived from very weak sources\"), have been contested since the 1970s as they are generally based on single remarks in the Chinese annals,[4] the History of the Chinese Sui dynasty contains entries of a state called Chenla, a vassal of the Kingdom of Funan, which had sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617, yet under its ruler, Citrasena Mahendravarman, conquered Funan after Chenla had gained independence.[5]\n\nLike its predecessor Funan, Chenla occupied a strategic position where the maritime trade routes of the Indosphere and the East Asian cultural sphere converged, resulting in prolonged socio-economic and cultural influence and the adoption of the epigraphic system of the south Indian Pallava dynasty and Chalukya dynasty.[6][7]\n\nThe origins of Chenla's aristocracy, whom author Michael Vickery called the \"Dângrêk Chieftains\", are obscure.[8] These were local principalities north and south of the Dângrêk Mountains, who left behind the oldest known stone epigraphs in the region, bearing genealogical records that suggest increasing political dominance. The first known princes are mentioned in some early inscriptions. The Sanskrit inscription of Vãl Kantél, Stung Treng province [9] names a ruler Vīravarman, who as his name suggests (his father's name was Sārvabhauma) had adopted the idea of divine kingship and deployed the concept of Harihara, a Hindu \"god that embodied multiple conceptions of power\". His successors continued this tradition, thus conveying the idea of a correlation between political and religious authority.[10]\n\nThe New Book of Tang asserts that shortly after 706, the country was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla. The names signify a northern and a southern half, which may conveniently be referred to as Upper (northern) and Lower (southern) Chenla.[11] By the late 8th century Water Chenla had become dependent on the thalassocratic Shailendra dynasty on Java and the Srivijaya city-state on Sumatra. The last of Water Chenla's kings seems to have been killed and the polity incorporated into the Javanese monarchy around the year 790. Land Chenla maintained its integrity under Jayavarman II, who proclaimed the Khmer Empire in 802.","privateMemo":"Polygon22_Chen-La\n真臘","show":true}},{"Position":[[[78.54606042058833,32.61091786407003,0],[80.9421529920894,30.91955840183399,0],[85.8579341849535,28.600793688218843,0],[88.53112664866038,28.03011215102299,0],[88.54770125274707,26.46753015169291,0],[87.80569654439023,25.076271323523827,0],[86.13618595058732,25.261772500613038,0],[85.30143065368587,25.81827603188067,0],[84.1884235911506,24.79801955789001,0],[82.79716476298151,24.79801955789001,0],[80.66390122645558,25.725525443336068,0],[77.13937886176056,29.25004780803108,0],[77.04662827321596,30.27030428202175,0],[78.54606042058833,32.61091786407003,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Kanauj","color":"#a4ed8e","image":"250px-Maukharis_of_Kanauj._Isanavarman._Circa_AD_535-553.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Kannauj (formerly Cannodge), is a city, administrative headquarters and a municipal board or Nagar Palika Parishad in Kannauj district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

CE to 897 CE, ruling a portion of southern India. They gained prominence after the eclipse of the Satavahana dynasty, whom the Pallavas served as feudatories.[2][3]\n\nPallavas became a major power during the reign of Mahendravarma I (571 – 630 CE) and Narasimhavarma I (630 – 668 CE) and dominated the Telugu and northern parts of the Tamil region for about 600 years until the end of the 9th century. Throughout their reign they were in constant conflict with both Chalukyas of Badami in the north and the Tamil kingdoms of Chola and Pandyas in the south and Pallava were finally defeated by the Chola Aditya I in the 9th century CE.[4]\n\nPallavas are most noted for their patronage of architecture, the finest example being the Shore Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mahabalipuram. The Pallavas, who left behind magnificent sculptures and temples, established the foundations of medieval South Indian architecture. They developed the Pallava script from which Grantha ultimately descended. The Pallava script gave rise to several other southeast Asian scripts. Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited Kanchipuram during Pallava rule and extolled their benign rule.","privateMemo":"Polygon28_Pallavas\nパッラヴァ朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[75.28436709086844,14.409953640894166,0],[74.72451557284033,14.172029055991603,0],[74.625100142163,14.39242626697626,0],[74.60517120361328,14.436607360839844,0],[74.58073794487179,14.478894581887264,0],[74.35679574322648,14.866476667560503,0],[74.23584747314453,15.075804710388184,0],[74.04509735107422,15.407447814941406,0],[73.77639770507812,16.054899215698242,0],[73.71171525888435,16.260928643049574,0],[73.69790095635621,16.304930578761862,0],[73.61295318603516,16.575510025024414,0],[73.59939843548813,16.633379501233897,0],[73.38837654760498,17.53429804474848,0],[73.26789093017578,18.048688888549805,0],[73.17977399630493,18.555538193539796,0],[73.05701446533203,19.26165199279785,0],[72.98617553710938,19.966659545898438,0],[72.9631576538086,20.074621200561523,0],[73.06809997558594,20.328954696655273,0],[73.08450278326427,20.354058340371097,0],[73.31334686279297,20.70429229736328,0],[73.3165283203125,20.84406280517578,0],[73.13479614257812,20.97072982788086,0],[79.64364475246492,22.20100307864105,0],[80.29289887227716,22.10825249009644,0],[80.38835327935071,20.96279960521386,0],[80.47840004936637,19.882238365025906,0],[82.55766296386719,17.102886199951172,0],[82.47108459472656,16.873991012573242,0],[82.43824768066406,16.664274215698242,0],[82.28507995605469,16.479713439941406,0],[81.99264526367188,16.345674514770508,0],[81.80043029785156,16.319849014282227,0],[81.57276153564453,16.36383628845215,0],[81.4567642211914,16.242883682250977,0],[81.29156494140625,15.843764305114746,0],[81.16677856445312,15.740370750427246,0],[80.93962860107422,15.854242324829102,0],[80.66342163085938,15.790118217468262,0],[80.5038833618164,15.662714958190918,0],[80.36709594726562,15.40829086303711,0],[80.2930679321289,15.192127227783203,0],[80.29073333740234,14.96340560913086,0],[79.64364475246492,14.9664571721618,0],[79.2726423982865,15.244708937795618,0],[79.2726423982865,17.285221885776945,0],[79.17989180974189,17.656224239955367,0],[78.25238592429584,17.470723062866156,0],[75.28436709086844,14.409953640894166,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Chalukya dynasty","color":"#52e466","image":"220px-6th_century_Kannada_inscription_in_cave_temple_number_3_at_Badami.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Chalukya dynasty ([tʃaːɭukjə]) was an Indian royal dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \"Badami Chalukyas\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \"Chalukyan architecture\".

Empire","color":"#bc40c0","image":"170px-Sui_Dynasty_Pilgrim_Flask.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The Sui dynasty (Chinese: 隋朝; pinyin: Suí cháo) was a short-lived imperial dynasty of China of pivotal significance. The Sui unified the Northern and Southern dynasties and reinstalled the rule of ethnic Han Chinese in the entirety of China proper, along with sinicization of former nomadic ethnic minorities (the Five Barbarians) within its territory. It was succeeded by the Tang dynasty, which largely inherited its foundation.\n\nFounded by Emperor Wen of Sui, the Sui dynasty capital was Chang'an (which was renamed Daxing, 581–605) and later Luoyang (605–618). Emperors Wen and Yang undertook various centralized reforms, most notably the equal-field system, intended to reduce economic inequality and improve agricultural productivity; the institution of the Three Departments and Six Ministries system; and the standardization and re-unification of the coinage. They also spread and encouraged Buddhism throughout the empire. By the middle of the dynasty, the newly unified empire entered a golden age of prosperity with vast agricultural surplus that supported rapid population growth.\n\nA lasting legacy of the Sui dynasty was the Grand Canal.[2] With the eastern capital Luoyang at the center of the network, it linked the west-lying capital Chang'an to the economic and agricultural centers of the east towards Hangzhou, and to the northern border near modern Beijing. While the pressing initial motives were for shipment of grains to the capital, and for transporting troops and military logistics, the reliable inland shipment links would facilitate domestic trades, flow of people and cultural exchange for centuries. Along with the extension of the Great Wall, and the construction of the eastern capital city of Luoyang, these mega projects, led by an efficient centralized bureaucracy, would amass millions of conscripted workers from the large population base, at heavy cost of human lives.\n\nAfter a series of costly and disastrous military campaigns against Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea,[3][4][5] ended in defeat by 614, the dynasty disintegrated under a series of popular revolts culminating in the assassination of Emperor Yang by his ministers in 618. The dynasty, which lasted only thirty-seven years, was undermined by ambitious wars and construction projects, which overstretched its resources. Particularly, under Emperor Yang, heavy taxation and compulsory labor duties would eventually induce widespread revolts and brief civil war following the fall of the dynasty.\n\nThe dynasty is often compared to the earlier Qin dynasty for unifying China after prolonged division. Wide-ranging reforms and construction projects were undertaken to consolidate the newly unified state, with long-lasting influences beyond their short dynastic reigns.","privateMemo":"Polygon30_SuiEmpire\n隋","show":true}},{"Position":[[[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0],[129.8449249267578,41.672821044921875,0],[129.79437255859375,41.48687744140625,0],[129.83473205566406,41.294761657714844,0],[129.76507568359375,41.08966064453125,0],[129.68148803710938,40.698997497558594,0],[129.38070678710938,40.647193908691406,0],[129.218505859375,40.54449462890625,0],[128.99468994140625,40.37131118774414,0],[128.65025329589844,40.08283996582031,0],[128.4398956298828,39.98656463623047,0],[128.13497924804688,39.97319793701172,0],[127.87519073486328,39.88340759277344,0],[127.75605010986328,39.781131744384766,0],[127.64446258544922,39.640628814697266,0],[127.48055267333984,39.2386589050293,0],[127.60822296142578,39.09231185913086,0],[125.49740600585938,38.70567321777344,0],[125.2315902709961,38.83259201049805,0],[125.41454315185547,39.2281379699707,0],[125.499755859375,39.38129806518555,0],[125.41020202636719,39.502254486083984,0],[125.1259994506836,39.63557815551758,0],[125.0636215209961,39.63545227050781,0],[124.89208984375,39.62234878540039,0],[124.75175476074219,39.558311462402344,0],[124.6465072631836,39.5899772644043,0],[124.41265106201172,39.75529861450195,0],[124.35340822733089,39.837979200062954,0],[124.3375473022461,39.86011505126953,0],[124.3144550752912,39.89237442539795,0],[124.3077392578125,39.901756286621094,0],[124.12019348144531,39.82485580444336,0],[123.5700912475586,39.766361236572266,0],[123.24272155761719,39.68917465209961,0],[122.23115539550781,39.27273178100586,0],[121.94683074951172,39.10641860961914,0],[121.69207000732422,38.89557647705078,0],[121.4201431274414,38.773929595947266,0],[121.26899719238281,38.76725387573242,0],[121.32736206054688,38.88209533691406,0],[121.71543884277344,39.1888313293457,0],[121.86381530761719,39.348487854003906,0],[121.65262603759766,39.39907455444336,0],[121.48583984375,39.36686325073242,0],[121.41700744628906,39.5006103515625,0],[121.44306945800781,39.570804595947266,0],[121.87179565429688,39.92237854003906,0],[121.9926528930664,40.09505081176758,0],[122.24018096923828,40.281009674072266,0],[122.31157684326172,40.37069320678711,0],[122.28601837158203,40.50498580932617,0],[124.90593196223253,42.32788079282051,0],[127.5029484414815,43.25538667826656,0],[129.45071080091822,45.20314903770328,0],[130.7492190405427,45.38865021479249,0],[132.32597904580098,44.64664550643565,0],[133.03102111816406,42.87887191772461,0],[132.798095703125,42.91694641113281,0],[132.6884002685547,42.897464752197266,0],[132.53675842285156,42.980655670166016,0],[132.3854522705078,43.21160888671875,0],[132.08676147460938,43.088951110839844,0],[131.87826538085938,43.043575286865234,0],[132.06881713867188,43.30735397338867,0],[131.78787231445312,43.22969436645508,0],[131.56045532226562,43.01082229614258,0],[131.26828002929688,42.766212463378906,0],[130.67127990722656,42.315757751464844,0],[130.63876342773438,42.293731689453125,0],[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Goguryeo","color":"#cb8fb1","image":"300px-Goguryeo_armor.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Goguryeo (고구려; 高句麗; [ko.ɡu.ɾjʌ], 37 BCE[note 1]–668 CE), also called Goryeo (고려; 高麗; [ko.ɾjʌ]) was a Korean kingdom[3][4][5][6][7] located in the northern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula and the southern and central parts of Manchuria.

While conventionally assigned to the period 250–710, including both the Kofun period (c. 250–538) and the Asuka period (538–710), the actual start of Yamato rule is disputed. The Yamato court's supremacy was challenged during the Kofun period by other polities centered in various parts of Japan. What is certain is that Yamato clans had major advantages over their neighbouring clans in the 6th century. This period is divided into the Kofun and Asuka periods, by the relocation of the capital to Asuka, in modern Nara Prefecture. However, the Kofun period is an archaeological period while the Asuka period is a historical period. Therefore, many think this as an old division and this concept of period division is no longer popular in Japan. At the era of Prince Shōtoku in the early 7th century, a new constitution was prescribed for Japan based on the Chinese model. After the fall of Baekje (660 AD), the Yamato government sent envoys directly to the Chinese court, from which they obtained a great wealth of philosophical and social structure. In addition to ethics and government, they also adopted the Chinese calendar and many of its religious practices, including Confucianism and Taoism (Japanese: Onmyo).","privateMemo":"Polygon34_Yamato","show":true}},{"Position":[[[112.88208770751953,-7.701803684234619,0],[113.27635192871094,-7.85984468460083,0],[113.46625518798828,-7.891205787658691,0],[113.76237487792969,-7.896928787231445,0],[113.96504211425781,-7.813857078552246,0],[114.15202331542969,-7.8071064949035645,0],[114.43443298339844,-7.914538383483887,0],[114.45585632324219,-8.003471374511719,0],[114.34127044677734,-8.1943941116333,0],[114.2728271484375,-8.416982650756836,0],[114.53294372558594,-8.76599407196045,0],[114.30841827392578,-8.671136856079102,0],[113.94747924804688,-8.582942008972168,0],[113.67835235595703,-8.469120025634766,0],[113.27745056152344,-8.330151557922363,0],[113.03944396972656,-8.330666542053223,0],[112.77464294433594,-8.445645332336426,0],[112.6180191040039,-8.471402168273926,0],[112.29704284667969,-8.427604675292969,0],[111.6427993774414,-8.365459442138672,0],[110.98139953613281,-8.303335189819336,0],[110.61904907226562,-8.189713478088379,0],[110.24183654785156,-7.9744391441345215,0],[109.74728393554688,-7.82296895980835,0],[109.31901311116025,-7.721778710573102,0],[109.2408676147461,-7.703314781188965,0],[108.8141098022461,-7.6851677894592285,0],[108.56436920166016,-7.8191680908203125,0],[108.3638916015625,-7.83867073059082,0],[107.93339538574219,-7.769688129425049,0],[107.57130432128906,-7.548023700714111,0],[107.41048431396484,-7.516592025756836,0],[106.68736267089844,-7.486388206481934,0],[106.5239028930664,-7.416821002960205,0],[106.54833221435547,-7.35321569442749,0],[106.75025177001953,-7.143050193786621,0],[106.5691909790039,-7.0226874351501465,0],[106.32121276855469,-6.97873592376709,0],[106.0936279296875,-6.915663242340088,0],[105.95589447021484,-6.903260707855225,0],[105.38844299316406,-6.848696708679199,0],[105.34754943847656,-6.764727592468262,0],[105.48983001708984,-6.754230976104736,0],[105.6710433959961,-6.796216011047363,0],[105.8371353149414,-6.738265514373779,0],[105.8676528930664,-6.502326488494873,0],[105.8758316040039,-6.439350605010986,0],[106.01441192626953,-6.464599609375,0],[105.99796304214092,-6.272302669193596,0],[107.74707308148047,-7.108182901454356,0],[110.0658377950956,-7.479185255632778,0],[112.88208770751953,-7.701803684234619,0]],[[115.2760238647461,-8.764389991760254,0],[115.09928894042969,-8.637656211853027,0],[114.7143783569336,-8.435100555419922,0],[114.66117095947266,-8.314461708068848,0],[114.84870147705078,-8.31404972076416,0],[115.07994842529297,-8.230934143066406,0],[115.2880630493164,-8.217761993408203,0],[115.70411682128906,-8.452033996582031,0],[115.55182647705078,-8.528626441955566,0],[115.4473648071289,-8.573341369628906,0],[115.2760238647461,-8.764389991760254,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Mataram","color":"#5446af","image":"220px-Borobudur_(6806826704).jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Medang Empire or Mataram Kingdom was a Javanese Hindu–Buddhist kingdom that flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was based in Central Java, and later in East Java. Established by King Sanjaya, the kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive rice farming, and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society,[1] had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of temple construction. Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan, all quite close to present-day city of Yogyakarta.[2] At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire—not only in Java, but also in Sumatra, Bali, southern Thailand, Indianized kingdoms of the Philippines, and the Khmer in Cambodia.[3][4][5]\n\nLater the dynasty divided into two kingdoms identified by religious patronage—the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war followed. The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the Shivaist dynasty of Medang kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga, son of Udayana of

(known to its inhabitants as Ērānshahr, or Iran,[1] in Middle Persian),[a] was the last kingdom of the Persian Empire before the rise of Islam. Named after the House of Sasan, it ruled from 224 to 651 AD.[2][13] The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire and was recognised as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighbouring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire for a period of more than 400 years.[14][15][16] The Sasanian Empire was founded by Ardashir I, after the fall of the Parthian Empire and the defeat of the last Arsacid king, Artabanus V. At its greatest extent, the Sasanian Empire encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Eastern Arabia (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatif, Qatar, UAE), the Levant (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan), the Caucasus (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan), Egypt, large parts of Turkey, much of Central Asia (Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan), Yemen and Pakistan. According to a legend, the vexilloid of the Sasanian Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani.[17] The Sasanian Empire during Late Antiquity is considered to have been one of Iran's most important, and influential historical periods and constituted the last great Iranian empire before the Muslim conquest and the adoption of Islam.[18] In many ways, the Sasanian period witnessed the peak of ancient Iranian civilisation. The Sasanians' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe,[19] Africa,[20] China and India.[21] It played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art.[22] Much of what later became known as Islamic culture in art, architecture, music and other subject matter was transferred from the Sasanians throughout the Muslim world.","privateMemo":"Polygon38_SasanianEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[57.56303328003041,23.87548569596313,0],[57.59996067066527,23.85401280604055,0],[57.65467834472656,23.822195053100586,0],[58.107879638671875,23.588085174560547,0],[58.28438186645508,23.518577575683594,0],[58.408958435058594,23.512487411499023,0],[58.66831970214844,23.52574348449707,0],[58.832157135009766,23.47526741027832,0],[59.22529983520508,23.037736892700195,0],[59.457984924316406,22.7459774017334,0],[59.66508483886719,22.555837631225586,0],[60.029354095458984,22.39142417907715,0],[60.04094696044922,22.29615020751953,0],[59.739356994628906,21.81902313232422,0],[59.4625129699707,21.49441909790039,0],[59.06501770019531,21.13144874572754,0],[58.97772429688755,20.958201827264514,0],[58.71571350097656,20.438201904296875,0],[58.60675048828125,20.37444496154785,0],[58.35411071777344,20.41202735900879,0],[58.2480354309082,20.449922561645508,0],[58.13493728637695,20.417909622192383,0],[57.65934065934064,21.701653128016567,0],[57.56303328003041,23.87548569596313,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Mazun","color":"#67d3d5","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Mazun was a Sasanian province in Late Antiquity, which corresponded to modern day Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and the northern half of Oman. The province served as a Sasanian outpost, and played an important role in the Sasanian efforts to gain control over the Indian Ocean trade, and to establish their dominance in the wealthy regions of Hadramaut and Yemen.[2]\n\nIn the 6th-century, the province was ruled by the clients and allies of the Sasanians, the Lakhmids.\n\nEastern Arabia was in c. 240 conquered by Ardashir I (r. 224–242), who made it into the province of Mazun. According to the 8th-century Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr, Ardashir appointed a certain Oshag of Hagar as marzban (general of a frontier province, \"margrave\") over the \"Do-sar and Borg-gil by the wall of the Arabs.\"[3] He also deported the prominent Azd tribe from Oman to Shihr on the Hadhramaut coast. During the childhood of shah Shapur II (r. 309–379), Arab nomads made several incursions into the Sasanian homeland of Pars, where they raided Gor and its surroundings.[4] Furthermore, they also made incursions into Meshan and Mazun. At the age of 16, Shapur II led an expedition against the Arabs; primarily campaigning against the Ayad tribe in Asoristan and thereafter he crossed the Persian Gulf, reaching eastern Arabia. He proceeded to attack the Banu Tamim in the Al Hajar Mountains. Shapur II reportedly killed a large number of the Arab population and destroyed their water supplies by stopping their wells with sand.[5]\n\nAfter having dealt with the Arabs of eastern Arabia, he continued his expedition into western Arabia and Syria, where he attacked several cities—he even went as far as Medina.[3] Because of his cruel way of dealing with the Arabs, he was called Dhū l-Aktāf \"he who pierces shoulders\" by them.[4][6] Not only did Shapur II pacify the Arabs of the Persian Gulf, but he also pushed many Arab tribes further deep into the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, he also deported some Arab tribes by force; the Taghlib to Bahrain and Hatta; the Banu Abdul Qays and Banu Tamim to Hagar; the Banu Bakr to Kirman, and the Banu Hanzalah to a place near Hormizd-Ardashir.[4] Shapur II, in order to prevent the Arabs from making more raids into his country, ordered the construction of a wall near al-Hirah, which became known as war-i tāzigān (\"wall of the Arabs\").\n\nWith Eastern Arabia more firmly under Sasanian control, and with the establishment of Sasanian garrison troops, the way for Zoroastrianism was opened. Pre-Islamic Arabian poets often makes mention of Zoroastrianism practices, which they must have either made contact with in Asoristan or Eastern Arabia.[2] In c. 531/2, shah Khosrow I (r. 531–579) appointed the Lakhmid king al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man as the ruler of Mazun.","privateMemo":"Polygon39_Mazun","show":true}},{"Position":[[[52.56026077270508,16.250917434692383,0],[52.441307067871094,16.11722755432129,0],[52.366519927978516,15.888344764709473,0],[52.33883285522461,15.704031944274902,0],[52.154075622558594,15.557498931884766,0],[51.802665540587974,15.39572562522666,0],[51.51622772216797,15.263862609863281,0],[50.494781494140625,14.975756645202637,0],[49.916526794433594,14.790260314941406,0],[49.537513732910156,14.649667739868164,0],[49.3768424987793,14.515887260437012,0],[49.1640510559082,14.235869407653809,0],[49.08296009080626,14.185691963525354,0],[48.968265533447266,14.114721298217773,0],[48.74040985107422,14.063409805297852,0],[48.47380828857422,14.094598770141602,0],[48.239830017089844,14.062329292297363,0],[47.86595916748047,13.864559173583984,0],[47.573238372802734,13.68602466583252,0],[47.14305877685547,13.507193565368652,0],[47.08139789932187,13.4908435844417,0],[46.80486297607422,13.41751766204834,0],[46.28295135498047,13.416388511657715,0],[46.02956771850586,13.422205924987793,0],[45.896141052246094,13.364731788635254,0],[45.7223014831543,13.224568367004395,0],[45.59964370727539,13.09087085723877,0],[45.39707946777344,12.950654983520508,0],[45.167236328125,12.842144012451172,0],[44.99246597290039,12.822709083557129,0],[44.88473129272461,12.841531753540039,0],[44.64419937133789,12.656749725341797,0],[44.26641082763672,12.630524635314941,0],[44.044254302978516,12.680885314941406,0],[43.808562270150674,12.845858841386786,0],[43.76371383666992,12.877250671386719,0],[43.68730926513672,12.946976661682129,0],[43.54451370239258,13.143637657165527,0],[43.50651168823242,13.257925987243652,0],[43.587642669677734,13.582152366638184,0],[43.55122756958008,13.868008613586426,0],[43.410606384277344,14.096443176269531,0],[43.256927490234375,14.623479843139648,0],[42.999542236328125,15.487052917480469,0],[42.96718978881836,15.683953285217285,0],[43.08754348754883,16.001893997192383,0],[43.03171157836914,16.33844757080078,0],[43.018062591552734,16.421100616455078,0],[42.96732711791992,16.66242790222168,0],[42.738956451416016,17.08763885498047,0],[42.41018295288086,17.531707763671875,0],[42.21310806274414,17.753652572631836,0],[41.83222198486328,18.064176559448242,0],[41.602840423583984,18.457616806030273,0],[41.40518689911197,18.91335865690136,0],[43.6700108077334,19.19623574963643,0],[45.682326847464445,16.01257156737537,0],[46.880028228652066,15.812954670510766,0],[49.075814094162695,16.61142225796918,0],[50.972174614376435,16.811039154833786,0],[52.56026077270508,16.250917434692383,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Sasanian dependencies","color":"#d6b4d7","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Sasanian dependencies","privateMemo":"Polygon40_Sasaniandependencies","show":true}},{"Position":[[[41.40518689911197,18.91335865690136,0],[41.23668670654297,19.3018798828125,0],[41.02342224121094,19.701692581176758,0],[40.897483825683594,19.885679244995117,0],[40.54001235961914,20.113658905029297,0],[39.967742919921875,20.42376708984375,0],[39.73056411743164,20.709184646606445,0],[39.37040328979492,21.23577308654785,0],[39.334075927734375,21.667734146118164,0],[39.307003021240234,22.01713752746582,0],[39.30585861206055,22.417417526245117,0],[39.2592658996582,22.5888614654541,0],[39.11875915527344,22.88718605041504,0],[38.69378662109375,23.629655838012695,0],[38.5330810546875,23.8516902923584,0],[38.19208526611328,24.13053321838379,0],[37.985511779785156,24.23175811767578,0],[37.760887145996094,24.2884578704834,0],[37.622474670410156,24.415237426757812,0],[37.40511703491211,24.67528533935547,0],[37.472206115722656,24.986753463745117,0],[37.421932220458984,25.183603286743164,0],[37.208919525146484,25.551658630371094,0],[36.87295913696289,26.0338077545166,0],[36.53342588426139,26.419734647469078,0],[36.51588821411133,26.439668655395508,0],[38.39631011190642,26.791883998063952,0],[38.99516080250023,26.592267101199347,0],[43.6700108077334,19.19623574963643,0],[41.40518689911197,18.91335865690136,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hejaz","color":"#61c1b7","image":"Al_Ula_(6708283401).jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Hejaz (/hiːˈdʒæz/; Arabic: ٱلْـحِـجَـاز‎, translit. al-Ḥijāz, lit.

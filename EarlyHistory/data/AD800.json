The Taíno name for the entire island was Haiti. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the Caribs.[40] In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique, or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Haiti was divided among five Caciquats: the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Xaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the center region of Cibao and the Higuey in the south east.[41][42] The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms, with payment consisting of harvests. Taíno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions.

AD 650. They engaged in farming and fishing[39] and hunting and gathering.[38] The fierce Caribs drove the Taíno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century.[40] The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand,[41] three hundred thousand,[38] and four hundred thousand to two million.[42] Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist.[43] By 1492 the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms.[44][45] The Taíno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.[46] The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagaríx, Guamá, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox,[47] measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans,[48] and from other causes discussed below. The first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507.[48] The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,[49] and some present-day Dominicans have Taíno ancestry.[50][51] Remnants of the Taino culture include their cave paintings,[52] as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Higüerito, Moca.","privateMemo":"Polygon3_DominicanRepublic","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0],[-66.94828796386719,18.003496170043945,0],[-66.98090362548828,18.098773956298828,0],[-66.95801544189453,18.34671401977539,0],[-67.00691223144531,18.45465850830078,0],[-66.95732879638672,18.53103256225586,0],[-66.85150909423828,18.563047409057617,0],[-66.60694122314453,18.53178596496582,0],[-66.4251708984375,18.53853416442871,0],[-65.74784088134766,18.48912811279297,0],[-65.57134246826172,18.413232803344727,0],[-65.52041625976562,18.349777221679688,0],[-65.60482025146484,18.190698623657227,0],[-65.63636016845703,18.14613151550293,0],[-65.76368713378906,18.044166564941406,0],[-65.91475677490234,18.024778366088867,0],[-66.24720001220703,18.06219482421875,0],[-66.54269409179688,18.02979278564453,0],[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Puerto Rico","color":"#41adf9","image":"250px-Taino_Village.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known. Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World (Aztec, Maya and Inca) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies, scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico's indigenous population. Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island.[44] The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people, an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland. Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years.[45] An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man, designated as the \"Puerto Ferro Man\", which was dated to around 2000 BC.[46] The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.[45] The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America. The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries. Between the 7th and 11th centuries, the Taíno culture developed on the island. By approximately 1000 AD, it had become dominant. At the time of Columbus' arrival, an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians, led by the cacique (chief) Agüeybaná, inhabited the island. They called it Boriken, meaning \"the great land of the valiant and noble Lord\".[47] The natives lived in small villages, each led by a cacique. They subsisted by hunting and fishing, done generally by men, as well as by the women's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit. This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493.","privateMemo":"Polygon4_PuertoRico","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0],[-77.22164154052734,17.848072052001953,0],[-77.53367614746094,17.949106216430664,0],[-77.63683319091797,18.069660186767578,0],[-77.84814453125,18.234472274780273,0],[-78.05746459960938,18.272167205810547,0],[-78.12120056152344,18.36737632751465,0],[-77.88275146484375,18.495004653930664,0],[-77.56583404541016,18.527469635009766,0],[-76.95218658447266,18.414358139038086,0],[-76.51549530029297,18.256389617919922,0],[-76.22268676757812,18.1362361907959,0],[-76.0970230102539,18.00937843322754,0],[-76.11492156982422,17.920360565185547,0],[-76.26403045654297,17.88826560974121,0],[-76.60188293457031,18.021024703979492,0],[-76.84659576416016,17.995073318481445,0],[-76.94862365722656,17.88043785095215,0],[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Jamaica","color":"#7b75f0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Arawak and Taíno indigenous people, originating in South America, settled on the island between 4000 and 1000 BC.[13] When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494, there were more than 200 villages ruled by caciques (chiefs of villages).

(Vietnamese: Chăm Pa) was a collection of independent Cham polities that extended across the coast of what is today central and southern Vietnam from approximately the 2nd century AD before being absorbed and annexed by Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mạng in AD 1832.[1] The kingdom was known variously as nagara Campa (Sanskrit: नगरः चम्पः; Khmer: ចាម្ប៉ា) in the Chamic and Cambodian inscriptions, Chăm Pa in Vietnamese (Chiêm Thành in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary) and 占城 (Zhànchéng) in Chinese records. The people of Champa descended from seafaring settlers who reached the Southeast Asian mainland from Borneo about the time of the Sa Huỳnh culture, the predecessor of the Cham kingdom.[4]:317 The Cham language is part of the Austronesian family. According to one study, Cham is related most closely to modern Acehnese in northern Sumatra.[8] To the Han Chinese, the country of Champa was known as 林邑 Linyi[9] in Mandarin and Lam Yap in Cantonese and to the Vietnamese, Lâm Ấp (which is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of 林邑). It was founded in AD 192.[10][11] Around the 4th century AD, Champan polities began to absorb much of Indic influences, probably through its neighbour, Funan. Hinduism was established as Champa began to create Sanskrit stone inscriptions and erect red brick Hindu temples. The first king acknowledged in the inscriptions is Bhadravarman,[12][13] who reigned from AD 380 to AD 413. At Mỹ Sơn, King Bhadravarman established a linga called Bhadresvara,[4]:324 whose name was a combination of the king's own name and that of the Hindu god of gods Shiva.[14] The worship of the original god-king under the name Bhadresvara and other names continued through the centuries that followed.[15] Rudravarman of Champa founded a new dynasty in 529 CE and was succeeded by his son Shambuvarman. Shambhuvarman reconstructed the temple of Bhadravarman and renamed it to Shambhu-bhadreshvara. He died in 629 and was succeeded by his son Kandarpadharma who died in 630-31. Kandarpadharma was succeeded by his son Prabhasadharma who died in 645.[16] Between the 7th to 10th centuries AD, the Cham polities rose to become a naval power; as Champan ports attracted local and foreign traders, Champan fleets also controlled the trade in spices and silk in the South China Sea, between China, the Indonesian archipelago and India. They supplemented their income from the trade routes not only by exporting ivory and aloe, but also by engaging in piracy and raiding.[17] However, the rising influence of Champa caught the attention of a neighbouring thalassocracy that considered Champa as a rival, the Javanese (Javaka, probably refers to Srivijaya ruler of Sumatra and Java). In AD 767, the Tonkin coast was raided by a Javanese fleet (Daba) and Kunlun pirates,[18][19] Champa was subsequently assaulted by Javanese or Kunlun vessels in AD 774 and AD 787.[20][21][22] In AD 774 an assault was launched on Po-Nagar in Nha-trang where the pirates demolished temples, while in AD 787 an assault was launched on Phang-rang.","privateMemo":"Polygon9_Champa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[97.62213897705078,16.499820709228516,0],[97.55565643310547,16.544143676757812,0],[97.41865539550781,16.95677947998047,0],[97.1867446899414,17.261205673217773,0],[97.08528137207031,17.362632751464844,0],[96.97404479980469,17.349679946899414,0],[96.93773651123047,16.904932022094727,0],[96.86656188964844,16.71419906616211,0],[96.67291259765625,16.52954864501953,0],[96.40756225585938,16.40192985534668,0],[95.9174575805664,16.17218589782715,0],[95.75598907470703,15.892321586608887,0],[95.62186431884766,15.758624076843262,0],[95.53347778320312,15.694902420043945,0],[95.4266357421875,15.821736335754395,0],[95.42385864257812,16.018661499023438,0],[95.32846069335938,16.012100219726562,0],[95.17630767822266,15.8529634475708,0],[95.03166961669922,15.85901165008545,0],[94.95707702636719,15.954141616821289,0],[95.02330780029297,16.176626205444336,0],[95.02294158935547,16.22744369506836,0],[94.7433853149414,16.15060806274414,0],[94.6192626953125,16.093175888061523,0],[94.50775146484375,15.965876579284668,0],[94.3480224609375,16.0227108001709,0],[94.3470230102539,16.232351303100586,0],[94.59566497802734,16.925331115722656,0],[94.66851806640625,17.281234741210938,0],[94.66897270362857,17.659783372849148,0],[94.66899871826172,17.68144416809082,0],[94.6241226196289,18.157785415649414,0],[94.4510726928711,18.595752716064453,0],[94.44780880385154,18.60388094133866,0],[95.80849724981206,18.877063103525295,0],[96.90293656450291,19.141238110519645,0],[97.2120289357989,19.215846613935916,0],[97.64760773489826,19.11905132524717,0],[97.9379936009645,18.393086660081558,0],[97.62213897705078,16.499820709228516,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Mon state","color":"#977657","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Mon State (Burmese: မွန်ပြည်နယ်, pronounced [mʊ̀ɴ pjìnɛ̀]; Mon: တွဵုရးဍုၚ်မန်၊ ရးမညဒေသ) is an administrative division of Myanmar.

The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant.[2] The thousand-year period, often referred to as the Pyu millennium, linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century. The city-states—five major walled cities and several smaller towns have been excavated—were all located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma: the Mu River Valley, the Kyaukse plains and Minbu region, around the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Part of an overland trade route between China and India, the Pyu realm gradually expanded south. Halin, founded in the 1st century AD at the northern edge of Upper Burma, was the largest and most important city until around the 7th or 8th century when it was superseded by Sri Ksetra (near modern Pyay) at the southern edge. Twice as large as Halin, Sri Ksetra was the largest and most influential Pyu centre.[2] The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on the Culture of Burma and political organisation.[3] The Pyu calendar, based on the Buddhist calendar, later became the Burmese calendar. Recent scholarship, though yet not settled, suggests that the Pyu script, based on the Indian Brahmi script, may have been the source of the Burmese script used to write the Burmese language. The millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the Kingdom of Nanzhao. The Bamar people, who came from Nanzhao, set up a garrison town at Bagan at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding Pagan Kingdom. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity. The histories and legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Bamar.[3] Only the city-states of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, where the other sites can be added in the future for an extension nomination.","privateMemo":"Polygon11_Pyustate","show":true}},{"Position":[[[37.683650970458984,18.836843490600586,0],[37.964900970458984,18.659526824951172,0],[38.098783710341564,18.57709439277184,0],[37.282737683340514,17.1117203642879,0],[35.53133440665001,15.439926327446965,0],[34.655632768304756,16.47484644549135,0],[34.01875884950821,16.793283404889625,0],[32.58579253221598,16.713674165040057,0],[31.86930937356987,16.63406492519049,0],[31.39165393447246,16.236018725942646,0],[30.993607735224618,15.519535567296533,0],[29.657065446970908,17.84651688190405,0],[28.8163610144062,20.57880628773937,0],[29.54838799437273,24.04494647386812,0],[31.02255300771365,23.676405220532892,0],[32.71784277305571,23.75011347119994,0],[35.39352798461914,24.41689109802246,0],[35.65712356567383,24.169660568237305,0],[35.860233306884766,24.011245727539062,0],[35.92835998535156,23.928791046142578,0],[35.81996536254883,23.852319717407227,0],[35.691593170166016,23.807567596435547,0],[35.67215347290039,23.737640380859375,0],[35.77951431274414,23.248632431030273,0],[35.89295196533203,23.038291931152344,0],[35.94996643066406,22.931312561035156,0],[36.315025329589844,22.66522789001465,0],[36.4938850402832,22.589353561401367,0],[36.676910400390625,22.354656219482422,0],[36.86409378051758,22.183509826660156,0],[37.00377655029297,21.93187141418457,0],[37.10716247558594,21.745620727539062,0],[37.3314323425293,21.24414825439453,0],[37.3686906948018,20.78124116472798,0],[37.45823669433594,19.668699264526367,0],[37.60184860229492,18.93197250366211,0],[37.683650970458984,18.836843490600586,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Makkura","color":"#a6d35c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Makkura","privateMemo":"Polygon12_Makkura","show":true}},{"Position":[[[30.993607735224618,15.519535567296533,0],[31.39165393447246,16.236018725942646,0],[31.86930937356987,16.63406492519049,0],[32.58579253221598,16.713674165040057,0],[34.01875884950821,16.793283404889625,0],[34.655632768304756,16.47484644549135,0],[35.53133440665001,15.439926327446965,0],[35.84977136604828,12.812821412411207,0],[35.61094364649958,11.300245855269413,0],[34.655632768304756,10.265325737225023,0],[33.77993112995951,10.026498017676317,0],[31.948918613419437,10.265325737225023,0],[31.47126317432203,10.663371936472862,0],[30.993607735224618,11.220636615419842,0],[30.67517077582634,13.52930457105732,0],[30.67517077582634,14.325396969553008,0],[30.993607735224618,15.519535567296533,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Alwa","color":"#97e1a7","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρογα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, 'Alwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now Central and Southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it controlled much of central and southern Sudan. It exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Alodia, a large, multicultural state, was administrated by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\",[3] prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.","privateMemo":"Polygon13_Alwa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-11.704808058091348,16.399217667634268,0],[-11.495833803486232,17.130627558752167,0],[-7.629810093291577,17.653063195264963,0],[-4.8086576561225,16.71267904954194,0],[-4.599683401517385,15.563320649213795,0],[-6.793913074871107,14.413962248885651,0],[-8.67468136631716,14.309475121583096,0],[-11.600320930788794,15.772294903818912,0],[-11.704808058091348,16.399217667634268,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Ghana","color":"#80532f","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Ghana was already recognized as one of the great kingdoms in Bilad el-Sudan by the ninth century.[22] Ghana was inhabited in the Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery by a number of ancient predominantly Akan kingdoms in the Southern and Central territories. This included the Ashanti Empire, the Akwamu, the Bonoman, the Denkyira, and the Mankessim Kingdom.[23] Although the area of present-day Ghana in West Africa has experienced many population movements, the Akans were firmly settled by the 5th century BC.[24][25] By the early 11th century, the Akans were firmly established in the Akan state called Bonoman, for which the Brong-Ahafo Region is named.[24][26] From the 13th century, Akans emerged from what is believed to have been the Bonoman area, to create several Akan states of Ghana, mainly based on gold trading.[27] These states included Bonoman (Brong-Ahafo Region), Ashanti (Ashanti Region), Denkyira (Central region), Mankessim Kingdom (Western region), and Akwamu Eastern region.[24] By the 19th century, the territory of the southern part of Ghana was included in the Kingdom of Ashanti, one of the most influential states in sub-saharan Africa prior to the onset of colonialism. The Kingdom of Ashanti government operated first as a loose network, and eventually as a centralised kingdom with an advanced, highly specialised bureaucracy centred in the capital city of Kumasi.[24] Prior to Akan contact with Europeans, the Akan people created an advanced economy based on principally gold and gold bar commodities then traded with the states of Africa.[24][28] The earliest known kingdoms to emerge in modern Ghana were the Mole-Dagbani states.[24] The Mole-Dagomba came on horseback from present-day Burkina Faso under a single leader, Naa Gbewaa.[29] With their advanced weapons and based on a central authority, they easily invaded and occupied the lands of the local people ruled by the Tendamba (land god priests), established themselves as the rulers over the locals, and made Gambaga their capital.[30] The death of Naa Gbewaa caused civil war among his children, some of whom broke off and founded separate states including Dagbon, Mamprugu, Mossi, Nanumba and

greatest florescence.[26] During the Early Classic (AD 250-600), cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.[32] At its height during the Late Classic, Tikal had expanded to have a population of well over 100,000.[24] Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.[33] In the southeast, Copán was the most important city.[33] Palenque and Yaxchilán were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region.[33] In the north of the Maya area, Coba was the most important Maya capital.[12] Capital cities of Maya kingdoms could vary considerably in size, apparently related to how many vassal cities were tied to the capital.[34] Overlords of city-states that held sway over a greater number of subordinate lords could command greater quantities of tribute in the form of goods and labour.[5] The most notable forms of tribute pictured on Maya ceramics are cacao, textiles and feathers.[5] During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift of population.[32] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.[32] Major cities in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.","privateMemo":"Polygon16_Mayacity-states","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-99.91201745294276,21.25450745070104,0],[-98.85702338340627,21.633525187743373,0],[-98.1353346839413,21.310910078288387,0],[-97.45850315289312,20.40846803689082,0],[-97.54310709427415,19.308616798937535,0],[-98.0225294287666,18.885597092032427,0],[-99.15058198051356,19.054804974794468,0],[-99.99662139432378,19.675233878255295,0],[-100.25043321846684,20.43666935068449,0],[-99.91201745294276,21.25450745070104,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Toltec

The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the Valley of Oaxaca where the latter's northern Etla, eastern Tlacolula, and southern Zimatlán & Ocotlán (or Valle Grande) branches meet. The present-day state capital Oaxaca City is located approximately 9 km (6 mi) east of Monte Albán.\n\nThe partially excavated civic-ceremonial center of the Monte Albán site is situated atop an artificially-leveled ridge, which with an elevation of about 1,940 m (6,400 ft) above mean sea level rises some 400 m (1,300 ft) from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks.[1] The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well.\n\nBesides being one of the earliest cities of Mesoamerica, Monte Albán's importance stems also from its role as the pre-eminent Zapotec socio-political and economic center for close to a thousand years. Founded toward the end of the Middle Formative period at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative (ca.100 BC-AD 200) Monte Albán had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist polity that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states such as Teotihuacan to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reutilization of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.\n\nThe etymology of the site's present-day name is unclear, and tentative suggestions regarding its origin range from a presumed corruption of a native Zapotec name to a colonial-era reference to a Spanish soldier by the name Montalbán or to the Alban Hills of Italy. The ancient Zapotec name of the city is not known, as abandonment occurred centuries before the writing of the earliest available ethnohistorical sources.","privateMemo":"Polygon19_MonteAlb�n\nモンテアルバン\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alb%C3%A1n","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-68.54573059082031,-54.871612548828125,0],[-69.01030731201172,-54.91704559326172,0],[-69.22037506103516,-54.863834381103516,0],[-69.46805572509766,-54.75712203979492,0],[-69.6573257446289,-54.757484436035156,0],[-69.87394714355469,-54.80479049682617,0],[-70.2945556640625,-54.90609359741211,0],[-70.51782989501953,-54.91992950439453,0],[-70.46131896972656,-54.76572036743164,0],[-70.37024688720703,-54.62492752075195,0],[-70.41708374023438,-54.48448181152344,0],[-70.00933837890625,-54.416805267333984,0],[-69.36412048339844,-54.442325592041016,0],[-69.16940307617188,-54.587833404541016,0],[-68.85179901123047,-54.58500671386719,0],[-69.13166046142578,-54.27470779418945,0],[-69.26985931396484,-54.20145034790039,0],[-69.52203369140625,-54.14848327636719,0],[-69.60195922851562,-54.108551025390625,0],[-69.68655395507812,-54.122074127197266,0],[-69.83879852294922,-53.96876525878906,0],[-69.9418716430664,-53.788761138916016,0],[-69.21691131591797,-53.527313232421875,0],[-69.23699951171875,-53.394100189208984,0],[-69.3109130859375,-53.327640533447266,0],[-70.12966918945312,-53.455772399902344,0],[-70.26104736328125,-53.35609817504883,0],[-70.14271545410156,-53.142845153808594,0],[-70.0768814086914,-53.06953811645508,0],[-69.59362030029297,-52.83588790893555,0],[-69.20305633544922,-52.54951477050781,0],[-69.01683807373047,-52.67531967163086,0],[-68.49767303466797,-52.703121185302734,0],[-68.12848663330078,-52.83306884765625,0],[-68.10171508789062,-52.92607879638672,0],[-68.26115417480469,-53.066036224365234,0],[-68.50159454345703,-53.21765899658203,0],[-68.4207534790039,-53.299293518066406,0],[-68.35379028320312,-53.332462310791016,0],[-68.08073425292969,-53.29863739013672,0],[-67.92601776123047,-53.358272552490234,0],[-67.63446044921875,-53.68427658081055,0],[-67.22604370117188,-53.9837760925293,0],[-66.77915954589844,-54.323692321777344,0],[-66.54266357421875,-54.423553466796875,0],[-66.2138671875,-54.590206146240234,0],[-66.10336303710938,-54.62346649169922,0],[-65.9143295288086,-54.623104095458984,0],[-65.69676971435547,-54.69633865356445,0],[-65.11939239501953,-54.7086296081543,0],[-65.05558013916016,-54.701805114746094,0],[-65.0584945678711,-54.80228042602539,0],[-65.14404296875,-54.896263122558594,0],[-65.36543273925781,-54.923492431640625,0],[-65.904541015625,-54.964744567871094,0],[-66.25434875488281,-55.05275344848633,0],[-66.41818237304688,-55.053070068359375,0],[-66.94889831542969,-54.89300537109375,0],[-67.28793334960938,-54.85344314575195,0],[-67.80550384521484,-54.841041564941406,0],[-68.17183685302734,-54.83502960205078,0],[-68.54573059082031,-54.871612548828125,0]],[[-73.567626953125,-43.491859436035156,0],[-73.74471282958984,-43.44075012207031,0],[-73.9381332397461,-43.42827606201172,0],[-74.03260803222656,-43.35129165649414,0],[-74.0923843383789,-43.2485237121582,0],[-73.99791717529297,-43.04262161254883,0],[-73.930419921875,-42.74689483642578,0],[-73.96981811523438,-42.515743255615234,0],[-73.96493530273438,-42.32952117919922,0],[-73.8011474609375,-42.00184631347656,0],[-73.43353271484375,-41.94978332519531,0],[-73.27140808105469,-42.097049713134766,0],[-73.25157165527344,-42.24463653564453,0],[-73.56123352050781,-42.44428634643555,0],[-73.6268539428711,-42.54716110229492,0],[-73.40493774414062,-42.89363098144531,0],[-73.49214935302734,-43.3695068359375,0],[-73.567626953125,-43.491859436035156,0]],[[-72.87669372558594,-53.01506423950195,0],[-73.0769271850586,-52.93565368652344,0],[-73.03966522216797,-52.55691909790039,0],[-73.42189025878906,-52.59084701538086,0],[-73.45472717285156,-52.42498779296875,0],[-73.3567886352539,-52.265625,0],[-72.98637390136719,-52.311317443847656,0],[-72.75764465332031,-52.21804428100586,0],[-72.66536712646484,-52.2642822265625,0],[-72.64119720458984,-52.62917709350586,0],[-72.76123046875,-52.78218078613281,0],[-72.87669372558594,-53.01506423950195,0]],[[-77.78806618628171,-10.217478071636416,0],[-78.09848022460938,-9.651933670043945,0],[-78.54727935791016,-8.769730567932129,0],[-78.85658264160156,-8.1985502243042,0],[-78.94388809971181,-8.075937352020494,0],[-79.47093963623047,-7.335739612579346,0],[-79.59339904785156,-7.177154541015625,0],[-79.86224365234375,-6.739306926727295,0],[-80.07030487060547,-6.549139976501465,0],[-80.13911718830825,-6.50914358460573,0],[-80.40792846679688,-6.35290002822876,0],[-80.81903839111328,-6.1885857582092285,0],[-81.09334564208984,-6.023963928222656,0],[-81.0398941040039,-5.947598934173584,0],[-80.95865631103516,-5.896602153778076,0],[-80.68443298339844,-5.883297443389893,0],[-80.61972045898438,-5.698888778686523,0],[-80.255701738752,-5.677747222257613,0],[-79.55066889391014,-5.677747222257613,0],[-78.958441304243,-5.846955105019656,0],[-78.06130157879664,-6.768958927313086,0],[-77.31101624885065,-6.953216134420996,0],[-77.13445643978301,-7.659455370691603,0],[-75.37273606409353,-10.595655996840751,0],[-71.0

Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day Peru and Chile and lasted from around AD 550 to 1000. Its capital was the monumental city of Tiwanaku, located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73).[2] One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later Inca Empire, but supporting evidence is weak. Tiwanaku was a multi-cultural \"hospitality state\"[3] that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of llama caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800.[2] Outside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \"soft power\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony.","privateMemo":"Polygon21_TiahuanacoEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[39.41160583496094,16.343481063842773,0],[39.72159194946289,15.480020523071289,0],[40.0001106262207,15.105743408203125,0],[40.09220504760742,15.20124626159668,0],[40.05985641479492,15.417208671569824,0],[40.10154724121094,15.51895809173584,0],[40.240875244140625,15.404888153076172,0],[40.42111587524414,15.100289344787598,0],[40.59354782104492,14.922759056091309,0],[40.83419418334961,14.942323684692383,0],[40.94280242919922,14.9362154006958,0],[40.376046962170975,9.859824772539298,0],[39.95569474588862,7.9682397992687015,0],[38.06410977261801,7.758063691127518,0],[36.80305312377095,9.229296448115768,0],[36.59287701562978,11.751409745809902,0],[37.223405340053304,13.642994719080498,0],[39.41160583496094,16.343481063842773,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Axum","color":"#69fae0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Axum was the centre of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Kingdom, which predated the earliest mentions in Roman-era writings. Around 356 CE, its ruler was converted to Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Sasanian Empire which had adopted Zoroastrianism. The historical record is unclear, with ancient church records the primary contemporary sources. It is believed it began a long and slow decline after the seventh century due partly to the Persians and then the Arabs contesting old Red Sea trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Kingdom of Aksum was finally destroyed by Empress Gudit[citation needed], and eventually some of the people of Aksum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the kingdom's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) king to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the kingdom's influence and power ended long before that. Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the Ethiopian Empire south to the Agaw region as it moved further inland. The city of Axum was the administrative seat of an empire spanning one million square miles. Eventually, the alternative name (Ethiopia) was adopted by the central region, and subsequently, the present modern state.","privateMemo":"Polygon22_Axum","show":true}},{"Position":[[[6.706557085241123,32.74958554916335,0],[5.88491518312304,32.832382152714494,0],[2.656781571158792,32.68564880671612,0],[0.6614669761348189,32.56441269496616,0],[1.0742263410410429,33.09088698689325,0],[1.4410657182678541,35.903322212298804,0],[1.7833569049835205,36.530860900878906,0],[2.4974379539489746,36.557796478271484,0],[2.72802734375,36.59012222290039,0],[3.013532876968384,36.730873107910156,0],[3.273670196533203,36.63582992553711,0],[3.5275015830993652,36.66820526123047,0],[3.790536880493164,36.80892562866211,0],[3.9448883533477783,36.85383987426758,0],[4.36758279800415,36.848323822021484,0],[4.598288059234619,36.85516357421875,0],[4.736215591430664,36.8299560546875,0],[4.835781097412109,36.811038970947266,0],[4.980855464935303,36.76035690307617,0],[5.348128795623779,36.68465042114258,0],[5.586396217346191,36.691505432128906,0],[5.933825969696045,36.7686767578125,0],[6.2510576248168945,36.85852813720703,0],[6.526534080505371,37.10762023925781,0],[6.974201202392578,36.879119873046875,0],[7.126706600189209,36.83481216430664,0],[7.266904830932617,36.898826599121094,0],[7.408516883850098,37.00743865966797,0],[7.510644912719727,37.077754974365234,0],[7.748586654663086,37.05911636352539,0],[7.9227070808410645,36.97024917602539,0],[7.995704650878906,36.84933090209961,0],[8.116838455200195,36.79222106933594,0],[8.348678588867188,36.8309211730957,0],[8.840373039245605,36.90222930908203,0],[9.069182395935059,36.98532485961914,0],[9.353943824768066,37.18984603881836,0],[9.619782447814941,37.29235076904297,0],[9.935863494873047,37.29936981201172,0],[10.225018501281738,37.217105865478516,0],[10.336398124694824,37.12171936035156,0],[10.36253547668457,37.01344680786133,0],[10.47517204284668,36.77152633666992,0],[10.596461296081543,36.733543395996094,0],[10.784246444702148,36.810394287109375,0],[11.046915054321289,37.008460998535156,0],[11.227420806884766,37.085296630859375,0],[11.243067741394043,36.92601776123047,0],[11.123725891113281,36.6709098815918,0],[10.837076187133789,36.44098663330078,0],[10.712908744812012,36.230525970458984,0],[10.715124130249023,36.10314178466797,0],[10.80627155303955,35.90591812133789,0],[11.034490585327148,35.696250915527344,0],[11.192615509033203,35.6392707824707,0],[11.32877254486084,35.2575798034668,0],[11.28646469116211,35.16200637817383,0],[11.043021202087402,34.8181266784668,0],[10.777688980102539,34.66508102416992,0],[10.320085525512695,34.25114059448242,0],[10.22314453125,34.098445892333984,0],[10.352320671081543,33.89537048339844,0],[10.616264343261719,33.64809799194336,0],[10.853880882263184,33.51515579223633,0],[10.981803894042969,33.49000549316406,0],[11.160202980041504,33.5920295715332,0],[11.30278205871582,33.55419921875,0],[11.41258430480957,33.26849365234375,0],[11.67435073852539,33.16106414794922,0],[12.320683479309082,32.89547348022461,0],[12.768420219421387,32.75661087036133,0],[13.002527236938477,32.75074005126953,0],[13.390789031982422,32.80873107910156,0],[13.662443161010742,32.79658126831055,0],[14.360687255859375,32.69635009765625,0],[14.637091636657715,32.48088073730469,0],[14.994474411010742,32.379966735839844,0],[15.21345043182373,32.38041305541992,0],[15.367368698120117,32.291778564453125,0],[15.445098876953125,32.19027328491211,0],[15.561793327331543,31.82199478149414,0],[15.737071990966797,31.568187713623047,0],[16.04698944091797,31.30197525024414,0],[16.217042922973633,31.245141983032227,0],[16.522050857543945,31.182233810424805,0],[16.986183166503906,31.145069122314453,0],[17.18744468688965,31.11371421813965,0],[17.625293731689453,31.012958526611328,0],[17.912643432617188,30.911895751953125,0],[18.16082191467285,30.785335540771484,0],[18.740877151489258,30.43071746826172,0],[19.089097961313787,30.238193373772322,0],[19.118690490722656,30.221832275390625,0],[19.328203201293945,30.21591567993164,0],[19.520145977462665,28.43684870257711,0],[18.174194088458087,28.62937618690167,0],[17.205616338408127,28.767923366123487,0],[12.736366442586439,30.821876509735155,0],[8.095953784797107,32.609576468063835,0],[6.706557085241123,32.74958554916335,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Aghlabids Emirate","color":"#69e8ef","image":"220px-Dinar_Aghlabide_-_192_AH_(obverse-reverse).jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Aghlabids (Arabic: الأغالبة‎) were an Arab[6] dynasty of emirs from the Nejdi tribe of Banu Tamim, who ruled Ifriqiya, nominally on behalf of the Abbasid Caliph, for about a century, until overthrown by the new power of the Fatimids.\nIn 800, the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid appointed Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, son of a Khurasanian Arab commander from the Banu Tamim tribe,[7] as hereditary Emir of Ifriqiya as a response to the anarchy that had reigned in that province following the fall of the Muhallabids.

The king was traditionally elected by the highest-ranking aristocrats, the dukes, as several attempts to establish a hereditary dynasty failed. The kingdom was subdivided into a varying number of duchies, ruled by semi-autonomous dukes, which were in turn subdivided into gastaldates at the municipal level. The capital of the kingdom and the center of its political life was Pavia in the modern northern Italian region of Lombardy.\n\nThe Lombard invasion of Italy was opposed by the Byzantine Empire, which retained control of much of the peninsula until the mid-8th century. For most of the kingdom's history, the Byzantine-ruled Exarchate of Ravenna and Duchy of Rome separated the northern Lombard duchies, collectively known as Langobardia Maior, from the two large southern duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, which constituted Langobardia Minor. Because of this division, the southern duchies were considerably more autonomous than the smaller northern duchies.\n\nOver time, the Lombards gradually adopted Roman titles, names, and traditions. By the time Paul the Deacon was writing in the late 8th century, the Lombardic language, dress and hairstyles had all disappeared.[1] Initially the Lombards were Arian Christians or pagans, which put them at odds with the Roman population as well as the Byzantine Empire and the Pope. However, by the end of the 7th century, their conversion to Catholicism was all but complete. Nevertheless, their conflict with the Pope continued and was responsible for their gradual loss of power to the Franks, who conquered the kingdom in 774. Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, adopted the title \"King of the Lombards\", although he never managed to gain control of Benevento, the southernmost Lombard duchy. The Kingdom of the Lombards at the time of its demise was the last minor Germanic kingdom in Europe, aside from the Frankish Empire.\n\nAny genetic legacy of the Lombards was quickly diluted into the Italian population owing to their relatively small number and their geographic dispersal in order to rule and administer their kingdom. Some regions were never under Lombard domination, including Sardinia, Sicily, Calabria, southern Apulia, Naples and the Latium. In all these regions the Byzantines brought more Greco-Anatolian lineages, which were already the dominant lineages from the Magna Graecia period.[2]\n\nA reduced Regnum Italiae, a heritage of the Lombards, continued to exist for centuries as one of the constituent kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire, roughly corresponding to the territory of the former Langobardia Maior. The so-called Iron Crown of Lombardy, one of the oldest surviving royal insignias of Christendom, may have originated in Lombard Italy as early as the 7th century and continued to be used to crown Kings of Italy until Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 19th century.","privateMemo":"Polygon25_Lombardduchies\nランゴバルド王国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-1.5985478266686295,32.44421227623339,0],[-4.569133623046419,31.67671937722227,0],[-6.526365667095389,29.5367043347238,0],[-8.363002638237576,27.175313943255276,0],[-9.478103656431049,26.1258071026026,0],[-10.986769739869274,25.732242037357842,0],[-14.428286370491943,25.699022786816148,0],[-14.163590431213379,26.136199951171875,0],[-13.984100341796875,26.289100646972656,0],[-13.802135467529297,26.378454208374023,0],[-13.425061225891113,26.608028411865234,0],[-13.262653350830078,26.830799102783203,0],[-13.112351417541504,27.180652618408203,0],[-12.919976234436035,27.563316345214844,0],[-12.856474876403809,27.689594268798828,0],[-12.662545204162598,27.874296188354492,0],[-12.470455169677734,27.912822723388672,0],[-11.886960983276367,28.041149139404297,0],[-11.372795104980469,28.245588302612305,0],[-11.169000625610352,28.385828018188477,0],[-10.652563095092773,28.768199920654297,0],[-10.135648727416992,29.163288116455078,0],[-9.665925025939941,29.659955978393555,0],[-9.458929061889648,29.97178840637207,0],[-9.39901065826416,30.20069122314453,0],[-9.421380043029785,30.423072814941406,0],[-9.613378524780273,30.772193908691406,0],[-9.654099464416504,31.07716178894043,0],[-9.609602928161621,31.306032180786133,0],[-9.431659698486328,31.592374801635742,0],[-9.113893508911133,31.980690002441406,0],[-9.01858901977539,32.27322006225586,0],[-9.047102928161621,32.43839645385742,0],[-9.015022277832031,32.59733200073242,0],[-8.436599731445312,33.13870620727539,0],[-8.110751152038574,33.35545349121094,0],[-7.698742389678955,33.50246047973633,0],[-7.1289567947387695,33.71334457397461,0],[-6.800343990325928,33.8919563293457,0],[-6.549310684204102,34.140323638916016,0],[-6.3078083992004395,34.47127151489258,0],[-6.268386138118028,34.547912227893995,0],[-6.098385334014893,34.87841033935547,0],[-5.725094795227051,35.74483108520508,0],[-5.604223251342773,35.80238723754883,0],[-5.3613362312316895,35.87931442260742,0],[-5.275695323944092,35.82217788696289,0],[-4.968125820159912,35.44073486328125,0],[-4.905967712402344,35.39628601074219,0],[-4.389313697814941,35.16815948486328,0],[-4.091687202453613,35.168758392333984,0],[-3.8242239952087402,35.15020751953125,0],[-3.237140417098999,35.183250427246094,0],[-3.002108573913574,35.285579681396484,0],[-2.8053643703460693,35.406951904296875,0],[-2.626213312149048,35.15903091430664,0],[-2.511143207550049,35.114715576171875,0],[-2.151998996734619,35.07088851928711,0],[-2.1222805903319846,35.07094914363152,0],[-1.9893101453781128,35.07122039794922,0],[-1.8315880298614502,35.07154083251953,0],[-1.5346641540527344,35.13580322265625,0],[-1.2914327383041382,35.25087356567383,0],[-1.1254419088363647,35.50587844848633,0],[-0.9430033564567566,35.646339416503906,0],[-0.7138282060623169,35.68500900268555,0],[-0.5306430459022522,35.75543212890625,0],[-0.22510702908039093,35.87704086303711,0],[-0.07932502031326294,35.775447845458984,0],[0,35.76769256591797,0],[0.11200962215662003,35.75674057006836,0],[0.21897460520267487,35.820640563964844,0],[0.402335524559021,36.0502815246582,0],[0.678054690361023,36.24193572998047,0],[0.9849061369895935,36.401824951171875,0],[1.2612667083740234,36.47882843017578,0],[1.7833569049835205,36.530860900878906,0],[1.4410657182678541,35.903322212298804,0],[1.0742263410410429,33.09088698689325,0],[0.6614669761348189,32.56441269496616,0],[-0.8776114583015442,32.47089767456055,0],[-1.5985478266686295,32.44421227623339,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Idrisid Caliphate","color":"#f63b5f","image":"220px-Place_es-Seffarine_fountain.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The founder of the dynasty was Idris ibn Abdallah (788–791),[7] who traced his ancestry back to Ali ibn Abi Talib[7] and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. After the Battle of Fakhkh, near Mecca, between the Abbasids and a Shiite party, Idris ibn Abdallah fled to the Maghreb. He first arrived in Tangier, the most important city of Morocco at the time, and by 788 he had settled in Volubilis.\n\nThe powerful Awraba Berbers of Volubilis (or Walili as the Berbers called it) took him in and made him their 'imam' (religious leader). The Awraba tribe was originally from the Tlemcen region and had supported Kusayla in his struggle against the Ummayad armies in the 670s and 680s. By the second half of the 8th century they had settled in northern Morocco, where their leader Ishak had his base in the Roman town of Volubilis. By this time the Awraba were already Muslim, but lived in an area where most tribes were either Christian, Jewish, Khariji or pagan. The Awraba seem to have welcomed a Sharifi imam as a way to strengthen their political position. Idris I, who was very active in the political organization of the Awraba, began by asserting his authority and working toward the subjugation of the Christian and Jewish tribes. In 789 he founded a settlement south east of Volubilis, called Medinat Fas. In 791 Idris I was poisoned and killed by an Abbasid agent. Even though he left no male heir, shortly after his death, his concubine Lalla Kanza bint Uqba al-Awrabi, bore him his only son and successor, Idris II. Idris' loyal Arab ex-slave and companion Rashid brought up the boy and took on himself the regency of the state, on behalf of the Awraba. In 801 Rashid was killed by the Abbasids. In the following year, at the age of 11 years, Idris II was proclaimed imam by the Awraba.\n\nEven though he had spread his authority across much of northern Morocco, as far west as Tlemcen, Idris I had been completely dependent on the Awraba leadership. Idris II began his rule with the weakening of Awraba power by welcoming Arab settlers in Walili and by appointing two Arabs as his vizier and qadi. Thus he transformed himself from a protégé of the Awraba into their sovereign. The Awraba leader Ishak responded by plotting against his life with the Aghlabids of Tunisia. Idris reacted by having his former protector Ishak killed, and in 809 moved his seat of government from the Awraba dominated Walili to Fes, where he founded a new settlement named Al-'Aliya. Idriss II (791–828) developed the city of Fez, established earlier by his father as a Berber market town. Here he welcomed two waves of Arab immigration: one in 818 from Cordoba and another in 824 from Aghlabid Tunisia, giving Fes a more Arab character than other Maghrebi cities. When Idris II died in 828, the Idrisid state spanned from western Algeria to the Sous in southern Morocco and had become the leading state of Morocco, ahead of the principalities of Sijilmasa, Barghawata and Nekor.\n\nThe dynasty would decline following Idriss II's death and under his son and successor Muhammad (828–836) the kingdom was divided amongst seven of his brothers, whereby eight Idrisid statelets formed in Morocco and Algeria.[8] Muhammad himself came to rule Fes, with only nominal power over his brothers. During this time Islamic and Arabic culture gained a stronghold in the towns and Morocco profited from the trans-Saharan trade, which came to be dominated by Muslim (mostly Berber) traders.","privateMemo":"Polygon26_IdrisidCaliphate\nイドリース朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0],[-2.557832956314087,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.711667776107788,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.7661285400390625,36.758121490478516,0],[-4.242921829223633,36.738990783691406,0],[-4.553639888763428,36.50307846069336,0],[-5.013072490692139,36.42656707763672,0],[-5.170563697814941,36.25444793701172,0],[-5.183085918426514,36.126956939697266,0],[-5.2205963134765625,36.088714599609375,0],[-5.253427028656006,36.184329986572266,0],[-5.284269332885742,36.190696716308594,0],[-5.281822681427002,36.082340240478516,0],[-5.456923484802246,36.02497863769531,0],[-5.646350383758545,36.088714599609375,0],[-6.000797271728516,36.299068450927734,0],[-6.1013078689575195,36.471195220947266,0],[-6.085216999053955,36.589149475097656,0],[-6.240361213684082,36.64015579223633,0],[-6.2968220710754395,36.735801696777344,0],[-6.2180495262146,36.80913543701172,0],[-6.428490161895752,37.03872299194336,0],[-6.744290828704834,37.16628646850586,0],[-6.806434631347656,37.18223190307617,0],[-7.024159908294678,37.242828369140625,0],[-7.287839889526367,37.225128173828125,0],[-7.399772644042969,37.17995071411133,0],[-7.632378578186035,37.049224853515625,0],[-7.829974174499512,37.025760650634766,0],[-8.07657527923584,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.337409973144531,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.463396072387695,37.13841247558594,0],[-8.787185668945312,37.006980895996094,0],[-8.812979698181152,37.08677291870117,0],[-8.637847900390625,37.542118072509766,0],[-8.647364616394043,37.927154541015625,0],[-8.729122161865234,37.97881317138672,0],[-8.619329452514648,38.223045349121094,0],[-8.64363956451416,38.40153884887695,0],[-8.585256576538086,38.45295333862305,0],[-8.649988174438477,38.5166130065918,0],[-8.818658828735352,38.47799301147461,0],[-9.032906532287598,38.43442153930664,0],[-9.081494331359863,38.63644027709961,0],[-8.86548900604248,38.65993118286133,0],[-8.738228797912598,38.758888244628906,0],[-8.757163047790527,38.83543395996094,0],[-8.837185859680176,38.93715286254883,0],[-8.972090721130371,38.749202728271484,0],[-9.157973289489746,38.68811798095703,0],[-9.318733215332031,38.7069091796875,0],[-9.345343589782715,38.79148864746094,0],[-9.256098747253418,38.97005081176758,0],[-9.194043159484863,39.24733352661133,0],[-9.2116060256958,39.38364791870117,0],[-9.095605850219727,39.43470764160156,0],[-8.91425895690918,39.661006927490234,0],[-8.711921691894531,40.155120849609375,0],[-8.766005516052246,40.20698928833008,0],[-8.490406036376953,41.0091438293457,0],[-8.648114204406738,41.424800872802734,0],[-8.651090621948242,41.61382293701172,0],[-8.717071533203125,41.783992767333984,0],[-8.602391242980957,41.906150817871094,0],[-8.656822204589844,42.0315055847168,0],[-8.5949068069458,42.21150207519531,0],[-8.440399169921875,42.43672180175781,0],[-5.345670471361123,42.26197477763753,0],[-3.968192743004482,42.26197477763753,0],[-1.7379907066175377,42.65553984288229,0],[-0.29491880072010446,42.91791655304546,0],[0.6889938623917828,42.5899456653415,0],[2.269151501318303,41.31256962240362,0],[1.8134924173355103,41.22612762451172,0],[1.6457593122426102,41.196970602202235,0],[1.5149086713790894,41.174224853515625,0],[1.0828657150268555,41.0387077331543,0],[0.937415599822998,40.89192581176758,0],[0.9134458303451538,40.802120208740234,0],[1.0307892560958862,40.7443962097168,0],[0.991220235824585,40.673858642578125,0],[0.7088053822517395,40.6097297668457,0],[0.44159138202667236,40.257171630859375,0],[0.043038755655288696,39.90299606323242,0],[0,39.816410064697266,0],[-0.08085206896066666,39.653743743896484,0],[-0.1911846399307251,39.45143127441406,0],[-0.032239049673080444,39.079376220703125,0],[0,39.029624938964844,0],[0.037968508899211884,38.97103500366211,0],[0.3297797739505768,38.83832550048828,0],[0.37623387575149536,38.75531768798828,0],[0.09665978699922562,38.60847091674805,0],[0,38.56100082397461,0],[-0.23149153590202332,38.44731140136719,0],[-0.36046302318573,38.23183822631836,0],[-0.4610650837421417,38.193546295166016,0],[-0.6686797738075256,37.776771545410156,0],[-0.598899781703949,37.63197708129883,0],[-0.7146084904670715,37.58731460571289,0],[-1.1609041690826416,37.565364837646484,0],[-1.4220486879348755,37.45646286010742,0],[-1.6132160425186157,37.3094482421875,0],[-1.7368113994598389,36.968570709228516,0],[-2.0351336002349854,36.74536895751953,0],[-2.1514337062835693,36.84102249145508,0],[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Umayyad

translit. al-Khilāfatu al-ʾUmawiyyah), also spelt Omayyad,[3] was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Muhammad. The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: ٱلأُمَوِيُّون‎, al-ʾUmawiyyūn, or بَنُو أُمَيَّة, Banū ʾUmayya, \"Sons of Umayya\"), hailing from Mecca. The third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656), was a member of the Umayyad clan. The family established dynastic, hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of Syria, who became the fifth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661. After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War[4] and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan. Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital. The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests, incorporating the Transoxiana, Sindh, the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 11,100,000 km2 (4,300,000 sq mi)[1] and 33 million people,[2] making it one of the largest empires in history in both area and proportion of the world's population. The dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rebellion led by the Abbasids in 750. Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Cordoba in the form of an Emirate and then a Caliphate, lasting until 1031. The Umayyad Caliphs were considered too secular by some of their Muslim subjects.[5] Christians, who still constituted a majority of the Caliphate's population, and Jews were allowed to practice their own religion but had to pay a head tax (the jizya) from which Muslims were exempt.[6] There was, however, the Muslim-only zakat tax, which was earmarked explicitly for various welfare progammes.[6][7] Muawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in Syria, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire.[6] Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious accommodation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria.

However, the combination of Leo III the Isaurian's military genius, the Byzantines' use of Greek Fire, a cold winter in 717–718, and Byzantine diplomacy with the Khan Tervel of Bulgaria resulted in a Byzantine victory. After Leo III turned back the Muslim assault in 718, he addressed himself to the task of reorganising and consolidating the themes in Asia Minor. In 740 a major Byzantine victory took place at the Battle of Akroinon where the Byzantines destroyed the Umayyad army once again.\n\nLeo III the Isaurian's son and successor, Constantine V, won noteworthy victories in northern Syria and also thoroughly undermined Bulgarian strength.[82] In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under Marwan II, Constantine V invaded Syria and captured Germanikeia. Coupled with military defeats on the other fronts of the overextended Caliphate and internal instability, the age of Arab expansion came to an end, and the Muslim world was divided, not to be united again.\nThe 8th and early 9th centuries were also dominated by controversy and religious division over Iconoclasm, which was the main political issue in the Empire for over a century. Icons (here meaning all forms of religious imagery) were banned by Leo and Constantine from around 730, leading to revolts by iconodules (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of empress Irene, the Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshiped. Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but, according to Theophanes the Confessor, the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favourites.[83]\n\nIn the early 9th century, Leo V reintroduced the policy of iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora restored the veneration of icons with the help of Patriarch Methodios.[84] Iconoclasm played a part in the further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called Photian schism, when Pope Nicholas I challenged the elevation of Photios to the

Empire","color":"#70d893","image":"220px-Dorestad_Brooch_AvL.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The Carolingian Empire (800–888) was a large empire in western and central Europe during the early Middle Ages. It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774. In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire. After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom. The unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the Carolingians continued to be acknowledged.\n\nIn 884, Charles the Fat reunited all the kingdoms of Francia for the last time, but he died in 888 and the empire immediately split up. With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child, the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or, in the case of the eastern kingdom, an illegitimate Carolingian. The illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911, while in the western kingdom the legitimate Carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936.\n\nThe size of the empire at its inception was around 1,112,000 square kilometres (429,000 sq mi), with a population of between 10 and 20 million people.[1] To the south it bordered the Emirate of Córdoba and, after 824, the Kingdom of Pamplona; to the north it bordered the kingdom of the Danes; to the west it had a short land border with Brittany, which was later reduced to a tributary; and to the east it had a long border with the Slavs and the Avars, who were defeated and their land incorporated into the empire. In southern Italy, the Carolingians' claims to authority were disputed by the Byzantines (eastern Romans) and the vestiges of the Lombard kingdom in the Principality of Benevento.\n\nUse of the term \"Carolingian Empire\" is a modern convention. The language of official acts in the empire was Latin.

al-ʿAbbāsiyyah) was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.[3] They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE (132 AH).\n\nThe Abbasid Caliphate first centred its government in Kufa, modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon. The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on Persian bureaucrats (notably the Barmakid family) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of non-Arab Muslims in the ummah (national community). Persianate customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite, and they began patronage of artists and scholars.[4] Baghdad became a centre of science, culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam.\n\nDespite this initial cooperation, the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab mawali (clients)[5] and Iranian bureaucrats.[6] They were forced to cede authority over Al-Andalus and the Maghreb to the Umayyads in 756, Morocco to the Idrisid dynasty in 788, Ifriqiya to the Aghlabids in 800 and Egypt to the Isma'ili-Shia caliphate of the Fatimids in 969.\n\nThe political power of the caliphs largely ended with the rise of the Iranian Buyids and the Seljuq Turks, which each captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055 respectively. Although Abbasid leadership over the vast Islamic empire was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function, the dynasty retained control over its Mesopotamian domain. The Abbasids' period of cultural fruition ended in 1258 with the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols under Hulagu Khan.

They ruled first at Ujjain and later at Kannauj.[1]\n\nThe Gurjara-Pratiharas were instrumental in containing Arab armies moving east of the Indus River.[2] Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin during the Caliphate campaigns in India. Under Nagabhata II, the Gurjara-Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra, who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja. Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I, the Pratihara Empire reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, the extent of its territory rivalled that of the Gupta Empire stretching from the border of Sindh in the west to Bengal in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to areas past the Narmada in the south.[3][4] The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian Subcontinent. During this period, Imperial Pratihara took the title of Maharajadhiraja of Āryāvarta (Great King of Kings of India).\n\nGurjara-Pratihara are known for their sculptures, carved panels and open pavilion style temples. The greatest development of their style of temple building was at Khajuraho, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[5]\n\nThe power of the Pratiharas was weakened by dynastic strife. It was further diminished as a result of a great raid led by the Rashtrakuta ruler Indra III who, in about 916, sacked Kannauj. Under a succession of rather obscure rulers, the Pratiharas never regained their former influence. Their feudatories became more and more powerful, one by one throwing off their allegiance until, by the end of the 10th century, the Pratiharas controlled little more than the Gangetic Doab. Their last important king, Rajyapala, was driven from Kannauj by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018.","privateMemo":"Polygon33_GurjaraPratihara\nプラティーハーラ朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[80.66342163085938,15.790118217468262,0],[80.5038833618164,15.662714958190918,0],[80.36709594726562,15.40829086303711,0],[80.2930679321289,15.192127227783203,0],[80.29073333740234,14.96340560913086,0],[80.36532592773438,14.271071434020996,0],[80.37338256835938,13.908957481384277,0],[80.27955627441406,13.686388969421387,0],[80.38179016113281,13.540488243103027,0],[80.4055004842248,13.50865748528523,0],[80.52354431152344,13.35018539428711,0],[80.51712036132812,13.121453285217285,0],[79.26480074180785,13.050751194591744,0],[79.19429568021702,15.165903042316183,0],[79.14971004038878,16.503472237163272,0],[78.91952863755068,17.53928854993473,0],[79.14971004038878,19.0354676683824,0],[79.03461933896973,20.41655608541101,0],[85.59478931985564,23.06364221804918,0],[86.7933200725644,24.33360857853526,0],[87.09096843830332,24.214549232239683,0],[88.29409462393859,21.914221815309723,0],[88.25670623779297,21.955713272094727,0],[88.07115173339844,21.713932037353516,0],[87.8443832397461,21.580053329467773,0],[87.39790344238281,21.401227951049805,0],[87.14086151123047,21.305400848388672,0],[87.0223617553711,21.203506469726562,0],[86.9998550415039,21.15264129638672,0],[87.0478744506836,20.892288208007812,0],[87.12977600097656,20.70823097229004,0],[86.97887420654297,20.485572814941406,0],[86.84151458740234,20.336078643798828,0],[86.83604431152344,20.220619201660156,0],[86.58928680419922,20.033716201782227,0],[86.32283020019531,19.823514938354492,0],[86.11260986328125,19.740480422973633,0],[85.91844177246094,19.71465492248535,0],[85.58277130126953,19.622346878051758,0],[85.3168716430664,19.459278106689453,0],[85.11028289794922,19.198383331298828,0],[84.86243438720703,18.950103759765625,0],[84.52817138463296,18.547265649391257,0],[84.46639251708984,18.47281265258789,0],[84.19134521484375,18.22446632385254,0],[83.88838195800781,18.100421905517578,0],[83.5850601196289,17.727651596069336,0],[83.2806396484375,17.517364501953125,0],[83.04975087780512,17.40038259790728,0],[82.95325469970703,17.351491928100586,0],[82.75008392333984,17.243059158325195,0],[82.55766296386719,17.102886199951172,0],[82.47108459472656,16.873991012573242,0],[82.43824768066406,16.664274215698242,0],[82.28507995605469,16.479713439941406,0],[81.99264526367188,16.345674514770508,0],[81.80043029785156,16.319849014282227,0],[81.57276153564453,16.36383628845215,0],[81.4567642211914,16.242883682250977,0],[81.29156494140625,15.843764305114746,0],[81.16677856445312,15.740370750427246,0],[80.93962860107422,15.854242324829102,0],[80.66342163085938,15.790118217468262,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hindu states","color":"#7df2b5","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Hindu states","privateMemo":"Polygon34_Hindustates","show":true}},{"Position":[[[75.64353356598919,11.76677332587766,0],[75.41460418701172,12.119339942932129,0],[75.1654052734375,12.893933296203613,0],[74.98126152939653,13.544879121893334,0],[74.93728637695312,13.70033073425293,0],[74.90665315509612,13.768242492163738,0],[74.625100142163,14.39242626697626,0],[74.60517120361328,14.436607360839844,0],[74.58073794487179,14.478894581887264,0],[74.35679574322648,14.866476667560503,0],[74.23584747314453,15.075804710388184,0],[74.04509735107422,15.407447814941406,0],[73.77639770507812,16.054899215698242,0],[73.71171525888435,16.260928643049574,0],[73.69790095635621,16.304930578761862,0],[73.61295318603516,16.575510025024414,0],[73.59939843548813,16.633379501233897,0],[73.38837654760498,17.53429804474848,0],[73.26789093017578,18.048688888549805,0],[73.17977399630493,18.555538193539796,0],[73.05701446533203,19.26165199279785,0],[72.98617553710938,19.966659545898438,0],[72.9631576538086,20.074621200561523,0],[73.06809997558594,20.328954696655273,0],[73.08450278326427,20.354058340371097,0],[75.23662619214106,20.53164678683006,0],[79.03461933896973,20.41655608541101,0],[79.14971004038878,19.0354676683824,0],[78.91952863755068,17.53928854993473,0],[79.14971004038878,16.503472237163272,0],[79.19429568021702,15.165903042316183,0],[79.26480074180785,13.050751194591744,0],[77.88371232477922,12.935660493172694,0],[75.93808673369493,11.270643152418044,0],[75.85541534423828,11.440461158752441,0],[75.79436057392535,11.534489605081252,0],[75.64353356598919,11.76677332587766,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Rashtrakuta state","color":"#bcc88f","image":"220px-Ellora-Kailasanatha-5.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Rashtrakuta (IAST: rāṣṭrakūṭa) was a royal dynasty ruling large parts of the Indian subcontinent between the sixth and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription is a 7th-century copper plate grant detailing their rule from Manapura, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of Achalapur (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra) and the rulers of Kannauj. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language.\n\nThe Elichpur clan was a feudatory of the Badami Chalukyas, and during the rule of Dantidurga, it overthrew Chalukya Kirtivarman II and went on to build an empire with the Gulbarga region in modern Karnataka as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, rising to power in South India in 753. At the same time the Pala dynasty of Bengal and the Prathihara dynasty of Malwa were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. An Arabic text, Silsilat al-Tawarikh (851), called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world.[2]\n\nThis period, between the eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.\n\nDuring their rule, Jain mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in Kannada and Sanskrit.

It was centered on present-day Yunnan in China. Nanzhao encompassed many ethnic and linguistic groups. Some historians believe that the majority of the population were of the Bai people,[2] but that the elite spoke a variant of Nuosu (also called Yi), a Tibeto-Burman language closely related to Burmese.[3] The ruling elite of Nanzhao were descended from the Cuan clan who migrated from Taiyuan to Yunnan during Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign in 225. By the fourth century they had gained control of the region, but they rebelled against the Sui dynasty in 593 and were destroyed by a retaliatory expedition in 602. The Cuan split into two groups known as the Black and White Mywa.[4] The White Mywa tribes settled on the fertile land around the alpine fault lake Erhai. These tribes were called Mengshe (蒙舍), Mengsui (蒙嶲), Langqiong (浪穹), Dengtan (邆賧), Shilang (施浪), and Yuexi (越析). Each tribe had its own kingdom, known as a zhao. In 704 the Tibetan Empire made these kingdoms into vassals or tributaries.[4] In the year 737 AD, with the support of the Tang Dynasty of China, Piluoge (皮羅閣) of Mengshe united the six zhaos in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao (Mandarin, \"Southern Zhao\"). The capital was established in 738 at Taihe, (the site of modern-day Taihe village, a few miles south of Dali). Located in the heart of the Erhai valley, the site was ideal: it could be easily defended against attack and it was in the midst of rich farmland.[5] In academia, the ethnic composition of the Nanzhao kingdom's population has been debated for a century. Chinese scholars tend to favour the theory that the rulers came from the aforementioned Bai or Yi groups, while some non-Chinese scholars subscribed to the theory that the Thai ethnic group was a major component, that later moved south into modern-day Thailand.","privateMemo":"Polygon36_NanChao","show":true}},{"Position":[[[76.96336833012498,33.20084734745733,0],[76.73280531058873,35.14816586704953,0],[76.73280531058873,36.98961708975435,0],[76.15735180349347,37.449979895430545,0],[75.35171689356012,37.79525199968769,0],[75.35171689356012,39.291431118135364,0],[75.58189829639822,40.212156729487766,0],[78.11389372761735,40.44233813232587,0],[80.18552635316026,40.78761023658302,0],[82.25715897870317,41.47815444509733,0],[85.82497072269376,43.4346963692212,0],[87.78151264681762,43.77996847347835,0],[90.6587801822939,43.77996847347835,0],[92.27005000216062,43.31960566780214,0],[94.80204543337973,41.132882340840176,0],[96.52840595466549,40.67251953516397,0],[99.17549208730367,41.01779163942113,0],[101.01694331000849,40.32724743090682,0],[101.47730611568468,39.40652181955441,0],[102.3980317270371,38.485796208202004,0],[104.2394829497419,38.0254334025258,0],[104.46966435258001,37.219798492592446,0],[104.46966435258,36.52925428407814,0],[103.33453468524655,34.17167728269329,0],[102.97348523413234,33.421805345763765,0],[103.2096095942551,33.185680985641014,0],[104.46966435258,31.925626227316105,0],[103.77912014406569,30.314356407449395,0],[104.35457365116095,28.70308658758268,0],[104.35457365116095,28.01254237906837,0],[103.20366663697044,26.401272559201658,0],[102.62821312987518,24.905093440753998,0],[102.16785032419898,22.603279412372977,0],[101.6331368884025,21.992178342891286,0],[99.63585489297985,21.91273520385867,0],[98.48494787878934,22.603279412372977,0],[98.6000385802084,24.44473063507779,0],[98.1396757745322,24.905093440753998,0],[94.68695473196067,24.674912037915895,0],[93.19077561351301,24.099458530820637,0],[91.85545082003785,22.373896133439214,0],[91.77473449707031,22.560285568237305,0],[91.61383819580078,22.73780632019043,0],[91.28504180908203,22.57830238342285,0],[91.10847473144531,22.577930450439453,0],[91.09284973144531,22.616008758544922,0],[90.98395538330078,22.7110652923584,0],[90.82337188720703,22.977523803710938,0],[90.76776123046875,22.99646759033203,0],[90.69905853271484,22.939149856567383,0],[90.68743133544922,22.69773292541504,0],[90.85551452636719,22.342363357543945,0],[90.85303497314453,22.15178108215332,0],[90.78889465332031,22.07541847229004,0],[90.58412170410156,22.036876678466797,0],[90.47822570800781,21.795255661010742,0],[90.36073303222656,21.750545501708984,0],[90.24607849121094,21.94722557067871,0],[90.10635375976562,22.124797821044922,0],[90.07334899902344,22.15019989013672,0],[90,21.849040985107422,0],[89.87384033203125,21.7368106842041,0],[89.7826156616211,21.717554092407227,0],[89.6602783203125,21.95868492126465,0],[89.43754577636719,21.672353744506836,0],[89.27591705322266,21.791311264038086,0],[89.19843292236328,21.646448135375977,0],[89.22920227050781,21.563932418823242,0],[89.08460235595703,21.531858444213867,0],[88.9271240234375,21.55692481994629,0],[88.86064147949219,21.874412536621094,0],[88.7712631225586,21.912338256835938,0],[88.65754699707031,21.753286361694336,0],[88.58071899414062,21.594308853149414,0],[88.50323486328125,21.568742752075195,0],[88.45159149169922,21.613094329833984,0],[88.32527160644531,21.879623413085938,0],[88.29409462393859,21.914221815309723,0],[87.09096843830332,24.214549232239683,0],[86.7933200725644,24.33360857853526,0],[85.9400614241128,24.67491203791589,0],[85.0193358127604,24.905093440753987,0],[83.40806599289368,24.79000273933494,0],[82.94770318721748,24.79000273933494,0],[81.79679617302698,25.250365545011142,0],[80.0704356517412,27.321998170554057,0],[79.48412453130453,27.647726570796653,0],[79.26480074180785,28.818177289001724,0],[78.6893472347126,30.544537810287483,0],[77.76862162336019,31.119991317382745,0],[77.30825881768399,31.350172720220844,0],[76.96298671342683,31.925626227316094,0],[76.96336833012498,33.20084734745733,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Tibetan Empire","color":"#5f4a68","image":"400px-Dunhuang_Zhang_Yichao_army.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Tibetan Empire (Tibetan: བོད་ཆེན་པོ, Wylie: bod chen po, \"Great Tibet\") existed from the 7th to 9th centuries AD when Tibet was unified as a large and powerful empire, and ruled an area considerably larger than the Tibetan Plateau, stretching to parts of East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia.\n\nTraditional Tibetan history described the exploits of a lengthy list of rulers. External corroboration is available from the 7th century in Chinese histories.[note 1] From the 7th to the 9th century a series of emperors ruled Tibet. From the time of the emperor Songtsen Gampo the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain. By the reign of the emperor Ralpacan, in the opening years of the 9th century, it controlled territories extending from the Tarim basin to the Himalayas and Bengal, and from the Pamirs to what is now Chinese provinces of Gansu and Yunnan.\n\nThe varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire. Thus, for example, adherents of the Bön religion[contradictory] and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently introduced Buddhism.

The name was still used in the 13th century by the Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan, author of The Customs of Cambodia.[1] It appears on the Mao Kun map. However, modern historiography applies the name exclusively to the period from the late 6th to the early ninth century.[2] It is dubious if \"Chenla\" ever existed as a unitary kingdom or if this is a misconception by Chinese chronists. Most modern historians assert that \"Chenla\" was in fact just a series of loose and temporary confederations of principalities.[3] Although most of the Chinese recordings on Chenla, including that of Chenla conquering Funan (\"derived from very weak sources\"), have been contested since the 1970s as they are generally based on single remarks in the Chinese annals,[4] the History of the Chinese Sui dynasty contains entries of a state called Chenla, a vassal of the Kingdom of Funan, which had sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617, yet under its ruler, Citrasena Mahendravarman, conquered Funan after Chenla had gained independence.[5] Like its predecessor Funan, Chenla occupied a strategic position where the maritime trade routes of the Indosphere and the East Asian cultural sphere converged, resulting in prolonged socio-economic and cultural influence and the adoption of the epigraphic system of the south Indian Pallava dynasty and Chalukya dynasty.[6][7] The origins of Chenla's aristocracy, whom author Michael Vickery called the \"Dângrêk Chieftains\", are obscure.[8] These were local principalities north and south of the Dângrêk Mountains, who left behind the oldest known stone epigraphs in the region, bearing genealogical records that suggest increasing political dominance. The first known princes are mentioned in some early inscriptions. The Sanskrit inscription of Vãl Kantél, Stung Treng province [9] names a ruler Vīravarman, who as his name suggests (his father's name was Sārvabhauma) had adopted the idea of divine kingship and deployed the concept of Harihara, a Hindu \"god that embodied multiple conceptions of power\". His successors continued this tradition, thus conveying the idea of a correlation between political and religious authority.[10] The New Book of Tang asserts that shortly after 706, the country was split into Land Chenla and Water Chenla. The names signify a northern and a southern half, which may conveniently be referred to as Upper (northern) and Lower (southern) Chenla.[11] By the late 8th century Water Chenla had become dependent on the thalassocratic Shailendra dynasty on Java and the Srivijaya city-state on Sumatra. The last of Water Chenla's kings seems to have been killed and the polity incorporated into the Javanese monarchy around the year 790. Land Chenla maintained its integrity under Jayavarman II, who proclaimed the Khmer Empire in 802.","privateMemo":"","show":true}},{"Position":[[[127.87519073486328,39.88340759277344,0],[127.75605010986328,39.781131744384766,0],[127.64446258544922,39.640628814697266,0],[127.48055267333984,39.2386589050293,0],[127.60822296142578,39.09231185913086,0],[128.15968322753906,38.71104431152344,0],[128.34780883789062,38.551605224609375,0],[128.65472412109375,38.272396087646484,0],[129.18458557128906,37.54737854003906,0],[129.3329315185547,37.3248291015625,0],[129.4536590576172,37.025848388671875,0],[129.4544677734375,36.688499450683594,0],[129.43899536132812,36.2620964050293,0],[129.38121032714844,35.975669860839844,0],[129.44540405273438,35.92491149902344,0],[129.67044067382812,35.9444580078125,0],[129.61590576171875,35.75986862182617,0],[129.48892211914062,35.524269104003906,0],[129.26368713378906,35.1867561340332,0],[129.1214141845703,35.04658126831055,0],[129.01217651367188,35.02728271484375,0],[128.75662231445312,35.122135162353516,0],[128.6416778564453,35.077392578125,0],[128.36814880371094,34.816436767578125,0],[128.1743621826172,34.8541374206543,0],[128.04415893554688,34.95543670654297,0],[127.79966735839844,34.91050338745117,0],[127.56275939941406,34.82115173339844,0],[127.02812194824219,34.445526123046875,0],[126.82044982910156,34.426063537597656,0],[126.61324310302734,34.28597640991211,0],[126.58869171142578,34.53985595703125,0],[126.56380462646484,34.6858024597168,0],[126.49030303955078,35.0030517578125,0],[126.4290771484375,35.180965423583984,0],[126.50396728515625,35.38462448120117,0],[126.72863006591797,35.5949592590332,0],[126.72843933105469,35.75398254394531,0],[126.8301010131836,35.94502639770508,0],[126.8105239868164,36.00860595703125,0],[126.64036560058594,36.148231506347656,0],[126.59749603271484,36.28176498413086,0],[126.60427856445312,36.49177551269531,0],[126.56510162353516,36.64443588256836,0],[126.43516540527344,36.701454162597656,0],[126.1639404296875,36.739097595214844,0],[126.45846557617188,36.92428207397461,0],[126.59459686279297,36.97548294067383,0],[126.8890151977539,36.85514450073242,0],[127.00328826904297,36.96358871459961,0],[126.98999786376953,37.09087371826172,0],[126.6466293334961,37.49129867553711,0],[126.59552001953125,37.63129425048828,0],[126.53409576416016,37.67840576171875,0],[126.41338348388672,37.77102279663086,0],[126.25616455078125,37.61787796020508,0],[126.1126708984375,37.52842712402344,0],[125.94483184814453,37.80192565917969,0],[125.7654037475586,37.85251998901367,0],[125.47303771972656,37.50165557861328,0],[125.38526916503906,37.67341613769531,0],[125.28062438964844,37.787845611572266,0],[124.97338104248047,37.95282745361328,0],[124.89732360839844,38.15651321411133,0],[124.93985748291016,38.2967529296875,0],[125.13301849365234,38.481910705566406,0],[125.47227478027344,38.58455276489258,0],[125.49740600585938,38.70567321777344,0],[125.2315902709961,38.83259201049805,0],[125.41454315185547,39.2281379699707,0],[125.499755859375,39.38129806518555,0],[125.41020202636719,39.502254486083984,0],[125.1259994506836,39.63557815551758,0],[125.0636215209961,39.63545227050781,0],[124.89208984375,39.62234878540039,0],[124.75175476074219,39.558311462402344,0],[124.6465072631836,39.5899772644043,0],[124.41265106201172,39.75529861450195,0],[124.35340822733089,39.837979200062954,0],[126.91235112929493,39.98197532664967,0],[127.87519073486328,39.88340759277344,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Silia","color":"#c7d2ca","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Silla (57 BCE[note 1] – 935 CE) (Hangul: 신라; Hanja: 新羅; RR: Silla Korean pronunciation: [ɕil.la]) was a kingdom located in southern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula.

After nearly 1,000 years of rule, Silla fragmented into the brief Later Three Kingdoms of Silla, Later Baekje, and Taebong, handing over power to Goryeo in 935.","privateMemo":"Polygon40_Silia","show":true}},{"Position":[[[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0],[129.8449249267578,41.672821044921875,0],[129.79437255859375,41.48687744140625,0],[129.83473205566406,41.294761657714844,0],[129.76507568359375,41.08966064453125,0],[129.68148803710938,40.698997497558594,0],[129.38070678710938,40.647193908691406,0],[129.218505859375,40.54449462890625,0],[128.99468994140625,40.37131118774414,0],[128.65025329589844,40.08283996582031,0],[128.4398956298828,39.98656463623047,0],[128.13497924804688,39.97319793701172,0],[127.87519073486328,39.88340759277344,0],[126.91235112929493,39.98197532664967,0],[124.35340822733089,39.837979200062954,0],[124.3375473022461,39.86011505126953,0],[124.3144550752912,39.89237442539795,0],[124.3077392578125,39.901756286621094,0],[124.12019348144531,39.82485580444336,0],[123.5700912475586,39.766361236572266,0],[123.24272155761719,39.68917465209961,0],[122.23115539550781,39.27273178100586,0],[121.94683074951172,39.10641860961914,0],[121.69207000732422,38.89557647705078,0],[121.4201431274414,38.773929595947266,0],[121.26899719238281,38.76725387573242,0],[121.32736206054688,38.88209533691406,0],[121.71543884277344,39.1888313293457,0],[121.86381530761719,39.348487854003906,0],[121.65262603759766,39.39907455444336,0],[121.48583984375,39.36686325073242,0],[121.41700744628906,39.5006103515625,0],[121.44306945800781,39.570804595947266,0],[121.87179565429688,39.92237854003906,0],[121.9926528930664,40.09505081176758,0],[122.24018096923828,40.281009674072266,0],[122.31157684326172,40.37069320678711,0],[122.28601837158203,40.50498580932617,0],[126.22180692078062,42.16869865361164,0],[128.75380235199975,43.6648777720593,0],[130.59525357470457,44.815784786249814,0],[131.9763419917332,45.16105689050697,0],[133.1272490059237,44.35542198057361,0],[133.03102111816406,42.87887191772461,0],[132.798095703125,42.91694641113281,0],[132.6884002685547,42.897464752197266,0],[132.53675842285156,42.980655670166016,0],[132.3854522705078,43.21160888671875,0],[132.08676147460938,43.088951110839844,0],[131.87826538085938,43.043575286865234,0],[132.06881713867188,43.30735397338867,0],[131.78787231445312,43.22969436645508,0],[131.56045532226562,43.01082229614258,0],[131.26828002929688,42.766212463378906,0],[130.67127990722656,42.315757751464844,0],[130.63876342773438,42.293731689453125,0],[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Parhae","color":"#6a5d4c","image":"150px-Pressapochista4.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Balhae (698–926), also known as Parhae or Bohai[2] was a multi-ethnic kingdom in Manchuria and the Korean peninsula.

Empire","color":"#71728e","image":"300px-Luoyang_longmen_grottoes_2.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Tang dynasty (/tɑːŋ/;[4] Chinese: 唐朝[a]) or the Tang Empire was an imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture.[6] Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty. The Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe Lǐ family (李) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was briefly interrupted when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Second Zhou dynasty (690–705) and becoming the only Chinese empress regnant. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.[7][8] Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.[9][10][b] With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road. Various kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a protectorate system. Besides political hegemony, the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian states such as those in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the An Lushan Rebellion and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry.[11] Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".[12]\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879.","privateMemo":"Polygon42_TangEmpire\n唐","show":true}},{"Position":[[[79.26480074180785,13.050751194591744,0],[80.51712036132812,13.121453285217285,0],[80.42742156982422,12.848063468933105,0],[80.12647247314453,12.12313461303711,0],[80.07040792019772,11.986062996849936,0],[79.97301483154297,11.747947692871094,0],[79.92894345120735,11.532891058722637,0],[79.91439819335938,11.4619140625,0],[79.93549346923828,11.16969108581543,0],[80.0299301147461,10.375699996948242,0],[79.99360656738281,10.267605781555176,0],[79.70458221435547,10.266985893249512,0],[79.50993347167969,10.272917747497559,0],[79.4261474609375,10.20919418334961,0],[79.27594757080078,9.776823043823242,0],[79.1302719116211,9.509651184082031,0],[77.65353092194114,9.59803015202022,0],[76.84789601200778,10.633846464791677,0],[76.25037190317737,10.629167966893082,0],[75.93808673369493,11.270643152418044,0],[77.88371232477922,12.935660493172694,0],[79.26480074180785,13.050751194591744,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Pallava state","color":"#cb425b","image":"220px-Kailasanathar_Temple.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Pallava dynasty was a South Indian dynasty that existed from 275 CE to 897 CE, ruling a portion of southern India.

The Pallavas, who left behind magnificent sculptures and temples, established the foundations of medieval South Indian architecture. They developed the Pallava script from which Grantha ultimately descended. The Pallava script gave rise to several other southeast Asian scripts. Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited Kanchipuram during Pallava rule and extolled their benign rule.","privateMemo":"Polygon43_Pallavastate\nパッラヴァ朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[79.1302719116211,9.509651184082031,0],[79.14138793945312,9.452491760253906,0],[79.36331176757812,9.29412841796875,0],[79.00131225585938,9.14720344543457,0],[78.8637924194336,9.140557289123535,0],[78.51750183105469,9.012736320495605,0],[78.38479614257812,8.828184127807617,0],[78.33943939208984,8.516746520996094,0],[78.26860809326172,8.402229309082031,0],[78.10342407226562,8.274786949157715,0],[78.05169146812739,8.249665755744896,0],[77.93759033700604,8.19425859750749,0],[77.8668441772461,8.159904479980469,0],[77.82227325439453,8.134393692016602,0],[77.7925033569336,8.115277290344238,0],[77.68805694580078,8.045159339904785,0],[77.62313842773438,8.045014381408691,0],[77.54503631591797,8.070255279541016,0],[76.90719604492188,8.723328590393066,0],[76.86605072021484,8.901147842407227,0],[76.74152374267578,9.135971069335938,0],[76.67087361373163,9.427097700471137,0],[76.58895111083984,9.764674186706543,0],[76.49766549273896,10.00191812663697,0],[76.45203945457197,10.120496510432202,0],[76.27872467041016,10.570927619934082,0],[76.25037190317737,10.629167966893082,0],[76.84789601200778,10.633846464791677,0],[77.65353092194114,9.59803015202022,0],[79.1302719116211,9.509651184082031,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Pandya state","color":"#eef240","image":"441px-S-TN-71_Vettuvan_Koil_Tuticorin.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Pandyan dynasty was an ancient Tamil dynasty of South India, one of the three Tamil dynasties, the other two being the Chola and the Chera.[3] The kings of the three dynasties were referred to as the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam.[4]\n\nThe Early Pandyans ruled parts of Southern India from at least 4th century BCE. Pandyan rule ended in the first half of the 16th century CE.[5] They initially ruled their country Pandya Nadu from Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas had diplomatic relations as far as Rome.[citation needed] The country of the Pandyans was described as Pandyas by Megasthenes, Pandi Mandala in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and described as Pandyan Mediterranea and Modura Regia Pandionis by Ptolemy.[6][7]\n\nThe Pandyan empire was home to temples including Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, and Nellaiappar Temple in Tirunelveli. Jainism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism flourished during the reign of the early Pandya kings, but after the revival of the Pandya power by Kadungon, the Shaivite Nayanars and the Vaishnavite Alvars rose to prominence and the non-Hindu sects declined.[8] Strabo states that an Indian king called Pandion sent Augustus Caesar \"presents and gifts of

Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture,[42] including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people.[43][44] Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon.[45] The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming,[46] a new style of pottery[47] and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.[48] Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han.[49] According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[50] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[51] Due to the defeat in Battle of Baekgang by Chinese Tang empire, Japanese government devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[52] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn seemingly everything from the Chinese writing system, literature, religion, and architecture, to even dietary habits at this time. Even today, the impact of the reforms can still be seen in Japanese cultural life.After the reforms, the Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, two rivals to the throne, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[53] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central government and its subordinate local governments.[52] These legal reforms created the ritsuryō state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[53] The Nara period (710–784) marked an emergence of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and architecture.[54] The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[55] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō, then to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[56] Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, Tendai by Saichō and Shingon by Kūkai.

Indonesian city-state based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, which influenced much of Southeast Asia.[2] Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 8th to the 12th century. Srivijaya was the first unified kingdom to dominate much of Indonesian archipelago.[3] The rise of the Srivijayan Empire is seen to run parallel to the end of the Malay sea-faring period. Due to its location, this once powerful state developed complex technology utilizing maritime resources. In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, thus transforming it into a prestige goods based economy.[4] The earliest reference to it dates from the 7th century. A Tang Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 for six months.[5][6] The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, dated 16 June 682.[7] Between the late 7th and early 11th century, Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring Java, Kambuja and Champa. Srivijaya's main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East. The kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the rival Javanese Singhasari and Majapahit empires.[2] After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. It was not until 1918 that French historian George Cœdès, of École française d'Extrême-Orient, formally postulated its

Medang Empire or Mataram Kingdom was a Javanese Hindu–Buddhist kingdom that flourished between the 8th and 11th centuries. It was based in Central Java, and later in East Java. Established by King Sanjaya, the kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive rice farming, and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society,[1] had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of temple construction. Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan, all quite close to present-day city of Yogyakarta.[2] At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire—not only in Java, but also in Sumatra, Bali, southern Thailand, Indianized kingdoms of the Philippines, and the Khmer in Cambodia.[3][4][5]\n\nLater the dynasty divided into two kingdoms identified by religious patronage—the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war followed. The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the Shivaist dynasty of Medang kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga, son of Udayana of Bali.","privateMemo":"Polygon49_Mataram\nマタラム","show":true}}]

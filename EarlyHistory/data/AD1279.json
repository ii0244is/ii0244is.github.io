feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shōgun by Emperor Go-Toba, and Yoritomo established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[57] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.\n\nAshikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, Kyoto. This was the start of the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The Ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (the art of Miyabi) prospered. This evolved to Higashiyama Culture, and prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyōs) and a civil war (the Ōnin War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").","privateMemo":"Polygon1_Japan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[120.82605743408203,21.942171096801758,0],[120.78024291992188,21.96748161315918,0],[120.73176574707031,22.11345863342285,0],[120.31710052490234,22.658824920654297,0],[120.16775512695312,23.103105545043945,0],[120.15394592285156,23.29998016357422,0],[120.22441864013672,23.636756896972656,0],[120.46998596191406,23.992958068847656,0],[121.06063842773438,24.82622528076172,0],[121.17686462402344,24.909048080444336,0],[121.36827087402344,24.966604232788086,0],[121.47129821777344,25.04939079284668,0],[121.63253021240234,25.151336669921875,0],[121.73502349853516,25.09440040588379,0],[121.98417663574219,24.917097091674805,0],[121.83403015136719,24.726245880126953,0],[121.79637145996094,24.662647247314453,0],[121.8067626953125,24.5229434967041,0],[121.7762222290039,24.24341583251953,0],[121.68519592285156,24.10984230041504,0],[121.60308074951172,23.950883865356445,0],[121.57374572753906,23.639610290527344,0],[121.52897644042969,23.41720962524414,0],[121.38607025146484,23.054882049560547,0],[121.17340087890625,22.736852645874023,0],[120.98564147949219,22.361713409423828,0],[120.97950744628906,22.20290756225586,0],[120.92830657958984,22.005903244018555,0],[120.82605743408203,21.942171096801758,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Taiwan","color":"#ff80c0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Taiwan","privateMemo":"Polygon2_Taiwan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-81.97356414794922,22.382883071899414,0],[-81.83690643310547,22.402240753173828,0],[-81.45892333984375,22.523813247680664,0],[-81.53572082519531,22.638078689575195,0],[-81.67611694335938,22.688623428344727,0],[-81.8419418334961,22.71371078491211,0],[-82.13508605957031,22.706724166870117,0],[-82.3587417602539,22.725332260131836,0],[-82.64907836914062,22.654788970947266,0],[-83.18601989746094,22.24046516418457,0],[-83.3530044555664,22.227386474609375,0],[-83.64688873291016,22.22676658630371,0],[-83.74163818359375,22.17571258544922,0],[-83.82683563232422,21.972116470336914,0],[-84.00495910644531,21.844614028930664,0],[-84.14879608154297,21.825233459472656,0],[-84.50273895263672,21.786563873291016,0],[-84.38623046875,21.932785034179688,0],[-84.17351531982422,22.073095321655273,0],[-84.23102569580078,22.339954376220703,0],[-84.10437774658203,22.511856079101562,0],[-84.05277252197266,22.55645751953125,0],[-83.48672485351562,22.831005096435547,0],[-82.75559997558594,23.042327880859375,0],[-82.23190307617188,23.081567764282227,0],[-81.85311126708984,23.152299880981445,0],[-81.4820327758789,23.134008407592773,0],[-81.22748565673828,23.153627395629883,0],[-80.89889526367188,23.078033447265625,0],[-80.5175552368164,23.040700912475586,0],[-80.24604034423828,22.952285766601562,0],[-79.99530029296875,22.901966094970703,0],[-79.78096008300781,22.89606475830078,0],[-79.55628967285156,22.775754928588867,0],[-79.2985610961914,22.53474998474121,0],[-79.12675476074219,22.420690536499023,0],[-78.86532592773438,22.34496307373047,0],[-78.51962280273438,22.294845581054688,0],[-77.96690368652344,22.137100219726562,0],[-77.50810241699219,21.91560173034668,0],[-77.30413818359375,21.77618408203125,0],[-77.13615417480469,21.528636932373047,0],[-76.98759460449219,21.46538543701172,0],[-76.77210235595703,21.446781158447266,0],[-76.00524139404297,21.213218688964844,0],[-75.5472412109375,21.137916564941406,0],[-75.40026092529297,21.030166625976562,0],[-75.55486297607422,20.76922035217285,0],[-75.44999694824219,20.699520111083984,0],[-75.19828033447266,20.68098258972168,0],[-74.85822296142578,20.71349334716797,0],[-74.6353988647461,20.637691497802734,0],[-74.40716552734375,20.46654510498047,0],[-74.14118194580078,20.339984893798828,0],[-73.9697265625,20.206865310668945,0],[-74.07449340820312,20.16851043701172,0],[-74.51597595214844,20.129426956176758,0],[-75.0335693359375,19.95035171508789,0],[-75.31539154052734,19.924325942993164,0],[-75.7896957397461,20.018665313720703,0],[-76.19479370117188,20.036867141723633,0],[-76.61502838134766,19.953338623046875,0],[-77.03948974609375,19.90158462524414,0],[-77.2571792602539,19.88840675354004,0],[-77.45928955078125,19.919761657714844,0],[-77.3004379272461,20.091726303100586,0],[-76.97294616699219,20.372106552124023,0],[-76.89506530761719,20.550247192382812,0],[-77.00623321533203,20.664432525634766,0],[-77.08751678466797,20.721467971801758,0],[-77.36756896972656,20.784433364868164,0],[-77.68267822265625,20.78376579284668,0],[-77.95372009277344,20.83403778076172,0],[-78.24669647216797,20.98597526550293,0],[-78.30996704101562,21.322738647460938,0],[-78.42588806152344,21.564041137695312,0],[-78.52421569824219,21.633760452270508,0],[-78.70222473144531,21.646085739135742,0],[-79.15444946289062,21.626060485839844,0],[-79.5308837890625,21.688825607299805,0],[-79.81036376953125,21.789936065673828,0],[-80.2405014038086,22.011503219604492,0],[-80.57283020019531,22.11886978149414,0],[-80.8495101928711,22.150060653686523,0],[-81.3686752319336,22.180744171142578,0],[-81.5886459350586,22.224775314331055,0]

The Taíno name for the entire island was Haiti. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the Caribs.[40] In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique, or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Haiti was divided among five Caciquats: the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Xaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the center region of Cibao and the Higuey in the south east.[41][42] The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms, with payment consisting of harvests. Taíno cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions.

AD 650. They engaged in farming and fishing[39] and hunting and gathering.[38] The fierce Caribs drove the Taíno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century.[40] The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand,[41] three hundred thousand,[38] and four hundred thousand to two million.[42] Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist.[43] By 1492 the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms.[44][45] The Taíno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.[46] The Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagaríx, Guamá, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox,[47] measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans,[48] and from other causes discussed below. The first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507.[48] The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,[49] and some present-day Dominicans have Taíno ancestry.[50][51] Remnants of the Taino culture include their cave paintings,[52] as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Higüerito, Moca.","privateMemo":"Polygon5_DominicanRepublic","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0],[-66.94828796386719,18.003496170043945,0],[-66.98090362548828,18.098773956298828,0],[-66.95801544189453,18.34671401977539,0],[-67.00691223144531,18.45465850830078,0],[-66.95732879638672,18.53103256225586,0],[-66.85150909423828,18.563047409057617,0],[-66.60694122314453,18.53178596496582,0],[-66.4251708984375,18.53853416442871,0],[-65.74784088134766,18.48912811279297,0],[-65.57134246826172,18.413232803344727,0],[-65.52041625976562,18.349777221679688,0],[-65.60482025146484,18.190698623657227,0],[-65.63636016845703,18.14613151550293,0],[-65.76368713378906,18.044166564941406,0],[-65.91475677490234,18.024778366088867,0],[-66.24720001220703,18.06219482421875,0],[-66.54269409179688,18.02979278564453,0],[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Puerto Rico","color":"#41adf9","image":"250px-Taino_Village.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known. Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World (Aztec, Maya and Inca) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies, scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico's indigenous population. Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island.[44] The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people, an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland. Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years.[45] An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man, designated as the \"Puerto Ferro Man\", which was dated to around 2000 BC.[46] The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.[45] The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America. The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries. Between the 7th and 11th centuries, the Taíno culture developed on the island. By approximately 1000 AD, it had become dominant. At the time of Columbus' arrival, an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians, led by the cacique (chief) Agüeybaná, inhabited the island. They called it Boriken, meaning \"the great land of the valiant and noble Lord\".[47] The natives lived in small villages, each led by a cacique. They subsisted by hunting and fishing, done generally by men, as well as by the women's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit. This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493.","privateMemo":"Polygon6_PuertoRico","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0],[-77.22164154052734,17.848072052001953,0],[-77.53367614746094,17.949106216430664,0],[-77.63683319091797,18.069660186767578,0],[-77.84814453125,18.234472274780273,0],[-78.05746459960938,18.272167205810547,0],[-78.12120056152344,18.36737632751465,0],[-77.88275146484375,18.495004653930664,0],[-77.56583404541016,18.527469635009766,0],[-76.95218658447266,18.414358139038086,0],[-76.51549530029297,18.256389617919922,0],[-76.22268676757812,18.1362361907959,0],[-76.0970230102539,18.00937843322754,0],[-76.11492156982422,17.920360565185547,0],[-76.26403045654297,17.88826560974121,0],[-76.60188293457031,18.021024703979492,0],[-76.84659576416016,17.995073318481445,0],[-76.94862365722656,17.88043785095215,0],[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Jamaica","color":"#7b75f0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Wari Empire was a political formation that emerged around AD 600 in the central highlands of Peru and lasted for about 500 years, to 1100 AD.

influence.","privateMemo":"Polygon7_Jamaica","show":true}},{"Position":[[[48.21838149170799,-17.005801100871388,0],[47.685732073379896,-16.887434563465145,0],[46.857166311536204,-17.716000325308844,0],[45.4959511313644,-22.62821162766793,0],[45.732684206176884,-23.575143926917878,0],[46.20615035580186,-23.575143926917878,0],[47.389815729864296,-23.101677777292903,0],[48.69184764133296,-20.024147804730585,0],[48.69184764133296,-19.43231511769937,0],[48.21838149170799,-17.005801100871388,0]],[[44.87586212158203,-16.218608856201172,0],[45.12101745605469,-16.186298370361328,0],[45.40060043334961,-16.02045440673828,0],[45.4814453125,-16.032995223999023,0],[45.637210845947266,-16.077144622802734,0],[45.758235931396484,-16.038753509521484,0],[45.935935974121094,-15.873130798339844,0],[46.345947265625,-15.80870532989502,0],[46.48560333251953,-15.935513496398926,0],[46.622867584228516,-15.922507286071777,0],[46.668025970458984,-15.83979320526123,0],[46.59121322631836,-15.674713134765625,0],[46.93808364868164,-15.432455062866211,0],[47.128231048583984,-15.343074798583984,0],[47.273189544677734,-15.444453239440918,0],[47.448307037353516,-15.348734855651855,0],[47.309791564941406,-15.126596450805664,0],[47.40296936035156,-14.999290466308594,0],[47.62993621826172,-14.808127403259277,0],[47.733184814453125,-14.941375732421875,0],[47.83653259277344,-14.966580390930176,0],[48.08738327026367,-14.699111938476562,0],[48.016212463378906,-14.610283851623535,0],[47.90262222290039,-14.426219940185547,0],[47.944828033447266,-14.2926664352417,0],[48.054054260253906,-14.298788070678711,0],[48.17533493041992,-14.266746520996094,0],[48.252655029296875,-14.114058494567871,0],[48.11920928955078,-13.720303535461426,0],[48.146121978759766,-13.567718505859375,0],[48.260929107666016,-13.548397064208984,0],[48.31361389160156,-13.580066680908203,0],[48.42726135253906,-13.77684211730957,0],[48.55327606201172,-13.82105827331543,0],[48.643314361572266,-13.636557579040527,0],[48.95500183105469,-13.400738716125488,0],[49.0609016418457,-13.235267639160156,0],[49.12112808227539,-13.031769752502441,0],[49.19695281982422,-12.720187187194824,0],[49.137081146240234,-12.561429977416992,0],[49.13849639892578,-12.459737777709961,0],[49.37999725341797,-12.249496459960938,0],[49.54026412963867,-12.395319938659668,0],[49.74541473388672,-12.687226295471191,0],[50.020851135253906,-12.813741683959961,0],[50.08413314819336,-12.90259075164795,0],[50.17985153198242,-13.283707618713379,0],[50.31211471557617,-14.10327434539795,0],[50.35386657714844,-14.40189266204834,0],[50.45808410644531,-14.757577896118164,0],[50.633811950683594,-15.087686538696289,0],[50.70700454711914,-15.297257423400879,0],[50.68996810913086,-15.46254825592041,0],[50.65876007080078,-15.532525062561035,0],[50.632991790771484,-15.577067375183105,0],[50.390987396240234,-15.939858436584473,0],[50.29218673706055,-15.882871627807617,0],[50.20722198486328,-15.717802047729492,0],[49.95742416381836,-15.381494522094727,0],[49.82394790649414,-15.445340156555176,0],[49.8014030456543,-15.636051177978516,0],[49.88864517211914,-16.029909133911133,0],[50.06641387939453,-16.264686584472656,0],[50.10190200805664,-16.44257354736328,0],[49.96400451660156,-16.72887420654297,0],[49.62837219238281,-17.180837631225586,0],[49.60830307006836,-17.38425636291504,0],[49.62650680541992,-17.78462791442871,0],[49.54551696777344,-18.210649490356445,0],[49.226722717285156,-19.16468048095703,0],[48.85531997680664,-20.322233200073242,0],[48.29104232788086,-22.02678871154785,0],[47.69525909423828,-24.042858123779297,0],[47.46214294433594,-24.748859405517578,0],[47.37747573852539,-24.86344337463379,0],[47.14912796020508,-25.149944305419922,0],[47.05872344970703,-25.200979232788086,0],[46.44276428222656,-25.246767044067383,0],[45.993160247802734,-25.393905639648438,0],[45.77984619140625,-25.60410499572754,0],[45.41416931152344,-25.64301300048828,0],[45.2504768371582,-25.433609008789062,0],[45.16218185424805,-25.37023162841797,0],[44.916664123535156,-25.288116455078125,0],[44.75001525878906,-25.320247650146484,0],[44.62899398803711,-25.29507827758789,0],[44.24042510986328,-24.971744537353516,0],[44.19342041015625,-24.863798141479492,0],[44.18465805053711,-24.60958480834961,0],[44.1378288269043,-24.501638412475586,0],[43.93085479736328,-24.336816787719727,0],[43.87507629394531,-24.209815979003906,0],[43.8753776550293,-23.885677337646484,0],[44.030738830566406,-23.395952224731445,0],[43.9883918762207,-23.249862670898438,0],[43.859031677246094,-23.034042358398438,0],[43.58002853393555,-22.615154266357422,0],[43.49492645263672,-22.39287567138672,0],[43.52849197387695,-22.09409523010254,0],[43.704689025878906,-21.477214813232422,0],[43.806880950927734,-21.381662368774414,0],[44.020137786865234,-21.298583984375,0],[44.36531448364258,-20.681337356567383,0],[44.67399978637695,-20.153165817260742,0],[44.720760345458984,-20.006881713867188,0],[44.7890510559082,-19.510995864868164,0],[44.739402770996094,-19.352201461791992,0],[44.61416244506836,

finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BC.[66][67] Early Holocene humans might have existed on the island 10,500 years ago, based on grooves found on elephant bird bones left by humans.[68] However, a counter study concluded that human-made marks date to 1,200 years ago at the earliest, in which the previously mentioned bone damage may have been made by scavengers, ground movements or cuts from the excavation process.[69] Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350 BC and 550 AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the last major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans.[70] Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[71] By 600 AD, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[72] Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries.[73] A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000 AD. South Indian Tamil merchants arrived around 11th century. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds. [53] Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later.[72] The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.[53] The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo,

The Black Death swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495.[30] The former outbreak killed 50% to 60% of the population, and the latter 30% to 50%.","privateMemo":"Polygon10_Iceland","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-7.287839889526367,37.225128173828125,0],[-7.399772644042969,37.17995071411133,0],[-7.632378578186035,37.049224853515625,0],[-7.829974174499512,37.025760650634766,0],[-8.07657527923584,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.337409973144531,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.463396072387695,37.13841247558594,0],[-8.787185668945312,37.006980895996094,0],[-8.812979698181152,37.08677291870117,0],[-8.637847900390625,37.542118072509766,0],[-8.647364616394043,37.927154541015625,0],[-8.729122161865234,37.97881317138672,0],[-8.619329452514648,38.223045349121094,0],[-8.64363956451416,38.40153884887695,0],[-8.585256576538086,38.45295333862305,0],[-8.649988174438477,38.5166130065918,0],[-8.818658828735352,38.47799301147461,0],[-9.032906532287598,38.43442153930664,0],[-9.081494331359863,38.63644027709961,0],[-8.86548900604248,38.65993118286133,0],[-8.738228797912598,38.758888244628906,0],[-8.757163047790527,38.83543395996094,0],[-8.837185859680176,38.93715286254883,0],[-8.972090721130371,38.749202728271484,0],[-9.157973289489746,38.68811798095703,0],[-9.318733215332031,38.7069091796875,0],[-9.345343589782715,38.79148864746094,0],[-9.256098747253418,38.97005081176758,0],[-9.194043159484863,39.24733352661133,0],[-9.2116060256958,39.38364791870117,0],[-9.095605850219727,39.43470764160156,0],[-8.91425895690918,39.661006927490234,0],[-8.711921691894531,40.155120849609375,0],[-8.766005516052246,40.20698928833008,0],[-8.490406036376953,41.0091438293457,0],[-8.648114204406738,41.424800872802734,0],[-8.651090621948242,41.61382293701172,0],[-8.717071533203125,41.783992767333984,0],[-8.602391242980957,41.906150817871094,0],[-8.201383590698242,42.019107818603516,0],[-7.953597545623779,42.10401153564453,0],[-7.714897155761719,41.9061393737793,0],[-6.894772052764893,41.884925842285156,0],[-6.65585470199585,42.00188446044922,0],[-6.505040645599365,41.97701644897461,0],[-6.382415771484375,41.87489318847656,0],[-6.314763069152832,41.76607131958008,0],[-5.935833930969238,41.54341125488281,0],[-5.90787410736084,41.43443298339844,0],[-6.037485122680664,41.33745193481445,0],[-6.592964172363281,41.109798431396484,0],[-6.63078498840332,41.07750701904297,0],[-6.653506755828857,40.8785514831543,0],[-6.621201038360596,40.67353820800781,0],[-6.680509090423584,40.23100662231445,0],[-6.655012130737305,39.808895111083984,0],[-6.674659252166748,39.71936798095703,0],[-6.880539894104004,39.61604690551758,0],[-7.097593307495117,39.59568405151367,0],[-7.227334976196289,39.5374870300293,0],[-7.007771968841553,39.31517791748047,0],[-6.803210735321045,39.06728744506836,0],[-6.729719638824463,38.97832107543945,0],[-6.88576078414917,38.81147384643555,0],[-7.113677024841309,38.516597747802734,0],[-7.190212726593018,38.31195831298828,0],[-6.824435234069824,38.256553649902344,0],[-6.641111373901367,38.117183685302734,0],[-7.038850784301758,37.8278694152832,0],[-7.147779941558838,37.661407470703125,0],[-7.284334659576416,37.23332595825195,0],[-7.287839889526367,37.225128173828125,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Portugal","color":"#eca363","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"On 24 June 1128, the Battle of São Mamede occurred near Guimarães. Afonso Henriques, Count of Portugal, defeated his mother Countess Teresa and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava, thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso then turned his arms against the Moors in the south.\n\nAfonso's campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of León, was transformed into the independent Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nAfonso then established the first of the Portuguese Cortes at Lamego, where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the Portuguese Restoration War. Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of León, and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III.\n\nDuring the Reconquista period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moorish domination. Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military monastic orders, pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the kingdom of Castile, Dinis I of Portugal signed with the king Fernando IV of Castile (which was represented, when being a minor, by his mother the queen Maria de Molina) the Treaty of Alcañices (1297), which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant Juan de Castilla. This treaty established inter alia the border demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon, where the disputed town of Olivenza was included.\n\nThe reigns of Dinis I (Denis I), Afonso IV (Alphons IV), and Pedro I (Peter I) for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia.\n\nIn 1348 and 1349 Portugal, like the rest of Europe, was devastated by the Black Death.[51] In 1373, Portugal made an alliance with England, which is the longest-standing alliance in the world. Over time, this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations' interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies.

Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Amerindians of South American origin.

ey_Church.jpg","religion":"","memo":"From 986, Greenland's west coast was settled by Icelanders and Norwegians, through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlements—known as the Eastern Settlement, the Western Settlement and the Middle Settlement—on fjords near the southwestern-most tip of the island.[9][34] They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with the Thule culture that entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261 under the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397). Later the Kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380, and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union.\nErik the Red's recruitment of others to settle in Greenland has been characterized recently as a land scam, the scam (and the name) portraying Greenland as better farm land than in Iceland.[36]\n\nThe Norse settlements, such as Brattahlíð, thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age.[37] Apart from some runic inscriptions, no contemporary records or historiography survives from the Norse settlements. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy as well as the bishops of Gardar and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the Konungs skuggsjá (The King's Mirror) describes Norse Greenland's exports and imports as well as grain cultivation.\n\nIcelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.[21] Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300, the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees Celsius higher than usual in the North Atlantic,[38] with trees and herbaceous plants growing, and livestock being farmed. Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel.[39] What is verifiable is that the ice cores indicate Greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100,000 years.[40]

1297, Pope Boniface VIII established on his own initiative (motu proprio) a hypothetical regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae (\"Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica\") in order to settle the War of the Sicilian Vespers diplomatically. This had broken out in 1282 between the Capetian House of Anjou and Catalans over the possession of Sicily. Despite the existence of the indigenous states, the Pope offered this newly created crown to James II of Aragon, promising him support should he wish to conquer Pisan Sardinia in exchange for Sicily.\nIn 1324, in alliance with the Kingdom of Arborea[59] and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so, the Aragon Crown Prince Alfonso led a Catalan army that occupied the Pisan territories of Cagliari and Gallura along with the allied city of Sassari, naming them \"The Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica\". The kingdom was to remain a dominion of the Crown of Aragon (under the Kings of Spain) until the Treaty of Utrecht.\nDuring this period, the Judicate of Arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the Carta de Logu ('Charter of the Land'). The Carta de Logu was originally compiled by Marianus IV of Arborea, and was amended and updated by Mariano's daughter, Female Judge (judikessa or juighissa) Eleanor of Arborea. The legal code was written in Sardinian and established a whole range of citizens' rights. Among the revolutionary concepts in this Carta de Logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property. In terms of civil liberties, the code made provincial 14th century Sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of Europe.[60]\n\nIn 1353, Peter IV of Aragon, following Aragonese customs, granted a parliament to the kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica, which was followed by some degree of self-government under a viceroy and judicial independence. This parliament, however, had limited powers. It consisted of high-ranking military commanders, the clergy and the nobility. The kingdom of Aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of Sardinia that it ruled.\n\nThe Sardinian Judicates never adopted feudalism, and Arborea maintained its parliament, called the Corona de Logu \"Crown of the Realm\". In this parliament, apart from the nobles and military commanders, also sat the representatives of each township and village. The Corona de Logu exercised some control over the king: under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom.\nBroken the alliance with the Crown of Aragon, from 1353[61] to 1409, the Arborean giudici Marianus IV, Hugh III and Brancaleone Doria (husband of Eleanor of Arborea), succeeded in occupying all of Sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the Castle of Cagliari and Alghero, which for years remained as the only Aragonese dominions in Sardinia (Sardinian-Catalan War).\n\nIn 1409, Martin I of Sicily, king of Sicily and heir to the crown of Aragon, defeated the Sardinians at the Battle of Sanluri. The battle was fought by about 20,000 Sardinian, Genoese and French knights, enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of Sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague. Despite the Sardinian army outnumbering the Aragonese army, they were defeated.\n\nThe Judicate of Arborea disappeared in 1420, when its rights were sold by the last king for 100,000 gold florins,[62] and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges. For example, Leonardo Cubello, with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the Kings of Arborea, was granted the title of Marquis of Oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the Kingdom of Arborea in exchange for his subjection to the Aragonese monarchs.\n\nThe conquest of Sardinia by the Kingdom of Aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout Sardinia. Thus Sardinia is probably the only European country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other European countries.","privateMemo":"Polygon17_Sardinia","show":true}},{"Position":[[[109.63331604003906,18.11359405517578,0],[109.14225006103516,18.34757423400879,0],[108.8555908203125,18.499420166015625,0],[108.7641372680664,19.077268600463867,0],[108.78056335449219,19.204343795776367,0],[108.88864135742188,19.31255531311035,0],[109.07734680175781,19.420930862426758,0],[109.40182495117188,19.701112747192383,0],[109.623779296875,19.676177978515625,0],[109.64591979980469,19.7524471282959,0],[109.75399017333984,19.93052864074707,0],[109.86132049560547,19.918058395385742,0],[110.11954498291016,19.816978454589844,0],[110.2642822265625,19.9570255279541,0],[110.46199035644531,19.957447052001953,0],[110.82101440429688,20.034433364868164,0],[111.08902740478516,19.7237548828125,0],[111.01547241210938,19.647382736206055,0],[110.81616973876953,19.4881591796875,0],[110.63069915771484,19.24639129638672,0],[110.50238037109375,18.915815353393555,0],[110.56513214111328,18.782548904418945,0],[110.46617889404297,18.64259910583496,0],[110.33497619628906,18.60420799255371,0],[109.87273406982422,18.43170738220215,0],[109.63331604003906,18.11359405517578,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hainan","color":"#9eb66c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Hainan","privateMemo":"Polygon18_Hainan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0],[80.54473876953125,5.986286640167236,0],[80.42581939697266,6.074979305267334,0],[80.33132934570312,6.2336320877075195,0],[80.2204360961914,6.512971878051758,0],[80.05775451660156,7.078125476837158,0],[80.04238891601562,7.370365619659424,0],[80.04439544677734,7.713481426239014,0],[80.03583526611328,8.12012004852295,0],[79.92784118652344,8.433548927307129,0],[80.01236724853516,8.66446304321289,0],[79.8782958984375,8.82190227508545,0],[79.90945434570312,8.947855949401855,0],[80.09967803955078,8.937359809875488,0],[80.25627899169922,9.13085651397705,0],[80.28018951416016,9.29610538482666,0],[80.3817367553711,9.462162017822266,0],[80.31324768066406,9.703569412231445,0],[80.55126190185547,9.487302780151367,0],[80.86608123779297,9.316428184509277,0],[80.9712905883789,9.138753890991211,0],[81.21858215332031,8.789820671081543,0],[81.29710388183594,8.643853187561035,0],[81.25273895263672,8.491267204284668,0],[81.26374053955078,8.427757263183594,0],[81.52980041503906,8.275839805603027,0],[81.6496353149414,7.94569206237793,0],[82.0085220336914,7.330141544342041,0],[82.06983184814453,7.10153341293335,0],[81.98268127441406,6.770936965942383,0],[81.80358123779297,6.46555233001709,0],[81.63754272460938,6.287286281585693,0],[81.4063491821289,6.096163272857666,0],[81.05546569824219,5.968320846557617,0],[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Sinhalese kingdom","color":"#9c5d82","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Sinhala Kingdom or Sinhalese Kingdom refers to the successive Sinhalese kingdoms that existed in what is today Sri Lanka.[1][2][3][4], the Sinhala Kingdom existed[citation needed] as successive kingdoms known by the city at which its administrative centre was located.

Deutschordensstaat (German: [ˈdɔʏtʃ ɔɐdənsˌʃtaːt]) or Ordensstaat[2] ([ˈɔɐdənsˌʃtaːt]) in German, was a crusader state formed by the Teutonic Knights or Teutonic Order during the 13th century Northern Crusades along the Baltic Sea. The state was based in Prussia after the Order's conquest of the Pagan Old Prussians which began in 1230. It expanded to include at various times Courland, Gotland, Livonia, Neumark, Pomerelia and Samogitia. Its territory was in the modern countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden (Gotland). Most of the territory was conquered by military orders, after which German colonization occurred to varying effect.\n\nThe Livonian Brothers of the Sword controlling Terra Mariana were incorporated into the Teutonic Order as its autonomous branch Livonian Order in 1237.[3] In 1346, the Duchy of Estonia was sold by the King of Denmark for 19,000 Köln marks to the Teutonic Order. The shift of sovereignty from Denmark to the Teutonic Order took place on 1 November 1346.[4]\n\nFollowing its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 the Teutonic Order fell into decline and its Livonian branch joined the Livonian Confederation established in 1422–1435.[5] The Teutonic lands in Prussia were split in two after the Peace of Thorn in 1466. The western part of Teutonic Prussia was converted into Royal Prussia, which became a more integral part of Poland.

a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories — the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece — that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon.\nAragon was originally a Carolingian feudal county around the city of Jaca, which in the first half of the 9th century became a vassal state of the kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarre), its own dynasty of counts ending without male heir in 922. The name Aragón is the same as that of the river Aragón, which flows by Jaca. It might derive from the Basque Aragona/Haragona meaning \"good upper valley\" (haran+goi+ona, where haran = \"valley\", goi = \"upper, high\", and ona = good). Alternatively, the name may be derived from the earlier Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis.[citation needed]\n\nOn the death of Sancho III of Navarre in 1035, the Kingdom of Navarre was divided into three parts: (1) Pamplona and its hinterland along with western and coastal Basque districts, (2) Castile, and (3) Sobrarbe, Ribagorza and Aragon. Sancho's son Gonzalo inherited Sobrarbe and Ribargorza, whereas his illegitimate son Ramiro received Aragon, but Gonzalo was killed soon after and all the land he owned went to his brother Ramiro, thus becoming the first de facto king of Aragon,[2] although he never used that title.\n\nBy defeating his brother, García Sánchez III of Navarre, Ramiro achieved independence for Aragon. His son Sancho Ramírez, who also inherited the kingdom of Navarre, was the first to call himself \"King of the Aragonese and Pamplonese\".[3] As the Aragonese domains expanded to the south, conquering land from Al Andalus, the capital city moved from Jaca to Huesca (1096), and later to Zaragoza (1118). After Alfonso the Battler died childless in 1135, different rulers were chosen for Navarre and Aragon, and the two kingdoms ceased to have the same ruler.

When the last Ayyubid ruler left Yemen in 1229, Umar stayed in the country as caretaker. He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title \"al-Malik Al-Mansur\" (the king assisted by Allah).[128] Umar established the Rasulid dynasty on a firm foundation and expanded its territory to include the area from Dhofar to Mecca[129]\n\nUmar first established himself at Zabid, then moved into the mountainous interior, taking the important highland centre Sana'a. However, the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz. He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249.[127] Omar's son Yousef defeated the faction led by his father's assassins and crushed several counter-attacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland. Mainly because of the victories he scored over his rivals, he assumed the honorific title \"al-Muzaffar\" (the victorious).\nAfter the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols in 1258, al-Muzaffar Yusuf I appropriated the title of caliph.[130] He chose the city of Taiz to become the political capital of the kingdom because of its strategic location and proximity to Aden.[131] al-Muzaffar Yusuf I died in 1296, having reigned for 47 years.[130] When the news of his death reached the Zaydi imam Al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya, he commented,[130]\nThe greatest king of Yemen, the Muawiyah of the time, has died. His pens used to break our lances and swords to pieces.\nThe Rasulid state nurtured Yemen's commercial links with India and the Far East.[132] They profited greatly by the Red Sea transit trade via Aden and Zabid.[127] The economy also boomed due to the agricultural development programs instituted by the kings who promoted massive cultivation of palms.[127] The Rasulid kings enjoyed the support of the population of Tihama and southern Yemen, while they had to buy the loyalty of Yemen's restive northern highland tribes.[127]\n\nThe Rasulid sultans built numerous Madrasas to solidify the Shafi'i school of thought, which is still the dominant school of jurisprudence amongst Yemenis today.[133] Under their rule, Taiz and Zabid became major international centres of Islamic learning.[134] The kings themselves were learned men in their own right, who not only had important libraries, but who also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects, ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy.[131]\n\nThe dynasty is regarded as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom.[135] They were of Turkic descent.[136] They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they doing anything out of the ordinary in the tribal context of Arabia.[137] By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu.[137]\n\nThey had a difficult relationship with the Mamluks of Egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state.[131] Their competition centred over the Hejaz and the right to provide kiswa of the Ka'aba in Mecca.[131] The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession, combined by periodic tribal revolts, as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands.[134] During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule, the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom. The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the Banu Taher clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of Yemen in 1454

height during the Late Classic, Tikal had expanded to have a population of well over 100,000.[24] Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.[33] In the southeast, Copán was the most important city.[33] Palenque and Yaxchilán were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region.[33] In the north of the Maya area, Coba was the most important Maya capital.[12] Capital cities of Maya kingdoms could vary considerably in size, apparently related to how many vassal cities were tied to the capital.[34] Overlords of city-states that held sway over a greater number of subordinate lords could command greater quantities of tribute in the form of goods and labour.[5] The most notable forms of tribute pictured on Maya ceramics are cacao, textiles and feathers.[5] During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift of population.[32] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.[32] Major cities in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.","privateMemo":"Polygon28_Mayacity-states","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-98.49252042740416,19.01926390949397,0],[-98.90403519798869,17.510376417350653,0],[-101.98610936517913,19.533657372724633,0],[-102.41477058453802,20.605310421121857,0],[-101.77177875549968,21.033971640480758,0],[-98.49252042740416,19.01926390949397,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Mixtec

the 11th century onwards, a series of Berber dynasties arose.[28][29][30] Under the Almoravid dynasty and the Almohad dynasty,[31] Morocco dominated the Maghreb, much of present-day Spain and

From the 13th century onwards the country saw a massive migration of the Banu Hilal Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Merinids held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain.

It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe during the country's Late Iron Age. Construction on the monument began in the 11th century and continued until the 15th century.[1][2] The edifices were erected by the ancestral Shona.[2] The stone city spans an area of 7.22 square kilometres (1,780 acres) which, at its peak, could have housed up to 18,000 people. It is recognised as a World Heritage site by UNESCO. Great Zimbabwe is believed to have served as a royal palace for the local monarch. As such, it would have been used as the seat of political power. Among the edifice's most prominent features were its walls, some of which were over five metres high. They were constructed without mortar (dry stone). Eventually, the city was abandoned and fell into ruin. The earliest known written mention of the Great Zimbabwe ruins was in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, captain of the Portuguese garrison of Sofala, on the coast of modern-day Mozambique, who recorded it as Symbaoe. The first confirmed visits by Europeans were in the late 19th century, with investigations of the site starting in 1871.[3] Later, studies of the monument were controversial in the archaeological world, with political pressure being put upon archaeologists by the government of Rhodesia to deny its construction by native African people.[4] Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government, and the modern independent state was named after it. The word great distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins, now known as \"zimbabwes\", spread across the Zimbabwe Highveld.[5] There are 200 such sites in southern Africa, such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manyikeni in Mozambique, with monumental, mortarless walls; Great Zimbabwe is the largest of these.","privateMemo":"Polygon37_GreatZimbabwe","show":true}},{"Position":[[[37.683650970458984,18.836843490600586,0],[37.964900970458984,18.659526824951172,0],[38.232261657714844,18.494911193847656,0],[38.51031494140625,18.266756057739258,0],[38.73113250732422,18.178287506103516,0],[38.84540557861328,18.077682495117188,0],[38.88933563232422,18.019777297973633,0],[39.107521014039975,17.381046823950662,0],[35.35964801038399,15.528453797497676,0],[32.988527884045425,15.302632833084477,0],[31.181960168739856,15.641364279704273,0],[29.71412390005408,20.0448730857616,0],[30.278676311087068,20.72233597900119,0],[31.181960168739856,20.94815694341439,0],[33.32725933066522,20.609425496794593,0],[37.683650970458984,18.836843490600586,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Makkura","color":"#a6d35c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Makkura","privateMemo":"Polygon38_Makkura","show":true}},{"Position":[[[31.181960168739856,15.641364279704273,0],[32.988527884045425,15.302632833084477,0],[35.35964801038399,15.528453797497676,0],[34.11763270611141,12.028228849093129,0],[33.44016981287182,11.46367643806014,0],[32.76270691963224,11.46367643806014,0],[31.407781133153055,11.802407884679933,0],[30.956139204326657,12.366960295712921,0],[31.181960168739856,15.641364279704273,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Alwa","color":"#97e1a7","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Archaeological evidence from Soba suggests a decline of the town, and therefore possibly the Alodian kingdom, from the 12th century.[71] By c. 1300 the decline of Alodia was well advanced.[72] No pottery or glassware postdating the 13th century has been identified at Soba.[73] Two churches were apparently destroyed during the 13th century, although they were rebuilt shortly afterwards.[74] It has been suggested that Alodia was under attack by an African, possibly Nilotic,[75] people called Damadim who originated from the border region of modern Sudan and South Sudan, along the Bahr el Ghazal River.[76] According to geographer Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, they attacked Nubia in 1220.[77] Soba may have been conquered at this time, suffering occupation and destruction.[76] In the late 13th century, another invasion by an unspecified people from the south occurred.[78] In the same period poet al-Harrani wrote that Alodia's capital was now called Waylula,[72] described as \"very large\" and \"built on the west bank of the Nile\".[79] In the early 14th century geographer Shamsaddin al-Dimashqi wrote that the capital was a place named Kusha, located far from the Nile, where water had to be obtained from wells.[80]\n\nEconomic factors also seem to have played a part in Alodia's decline. From the 10th to 12th centuries the East African coast saw the rise of new trading cities such as Kilwa. These were direct mercantile competitors since they exported similar goods to Nubia.[81] A period of severe droughts occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1150 and 1500 would have affected the Nubian economy as well.[82] Archeobotanical evidence from Soba suggests the town suffered from overgrazing and overcultivation.[83]\n\nBy 1276 al-Abwab, previously described as the northernmost Alodian province, was recorded as an independent splinter kingdom ruling over vast territories. The precise circumstances of its secession and its relations with Alodia thereafter remain unknown.[84] Based on pottery finds it has been suggested that al-Abwab continued to thrive until the 15th and perhaps even the 16th century.[85] In 1286 a Mamluke prince sent messengers to several rulers in central Sudan. It is not clear if they were still subject to the king in Soba[86] or if they were independent, implying a fragmentation of Alodia into multiple petty states by the late 13th century.[72] In 1317 a Mamluk expedition pursued Arab brigands as far south as Kassala in Taka (one of the regions which received a Mamluk messenger in 1286[86]), marching through al-Abwab and Makuria on their return.","privateMemo":"Polygon39_Alwa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[46.53893499773435,14.113818176663823,0],[46.86307629846987,15.441737824731506,0],[48.04125031682607,16.43865430180214,0],[50.71479905078823,17.163684466944417,0],[54.15869233521405,19.746604430263783,0],[57.14944176642595,20.652892136691634,0],[58.13493728637695,20.417909622192383,0],[58.00974655151367,20.188932418823242,0],[57.98121643066406,19.686962127685547,0],[57.98208999633789,19.3311824798584,0],[58.042293548583984,19.05177879333496,0],[57.86069869995117,18.987857818603516,0],[57.38987350463867,18.955080032348633,0],[57.107975006103516,18.833772659301758,0],[56.94255065917969,18.706348419189453,0],[56.81226348876953,18.483713150024414,0],[56.75302505493164,18.235801696777344,0],[56.661216735839844,18.10853385925293,0],[56.46125411987305,17.993745803833008,0],[56.21650695800781,17.94875717163086,0],[56.085208892822266,17.948482513427734,0],[55.911781311035156,17.96715545654297,0],[55.76473617553711,17.954143524169922,0],[55.5931510925293,17.82671356201172,0],[55.49407196044922,17.693071365356445,0],[55.4380989074707,17.4642333984375,0],[55.439300537109375,17.30540657043457,0],[55.398502349853516,17.165536880493164,0],[55.11427688598633,16.987031936645508,0],[54.95974349975586,16.96764373779297,0],[54.610538482666016,17.062192916870117,0],[54.28792190551758,17.036090850830078,0],[53.88491439819336,16.914512634277344,0],[53.539398193359375,16.780351638793945,0],[53.41211700439453,16.735605239868164,0],[53.224613189697266,16.670740127563477,0],[53.09798812866211,16.626924514770508,0],[52.855831146240234,16.505691528320312,0],[52.56026077270508,16.250917434692383,0],[52.441307067871094,16.11722755432129,0],[52.366519927978516,15.888344764709473,0],[52.33883285522461,15.704031944274902,0],[52.154075622558594,15.557498931884766,0],[51.802665540587974,15.39572562522666,0],[51.51622772216797,15.263862609863281,0],[50.494781494140625,14.975756645202637,0],[49.916526794433594,14.790260314941406,0],[49.537513732910156,14.649667739868164,0],[49.3768424987793,14.515887260437012,0],[49.1640510559082,14.235869407653809,0],[48.968265533447266,14.114721298217773,0],[48.74040985107422,14.063409805297852,0],[48.47380828857422,14.094598770141602,0],[48.239830017089844,14.062329292297363,0],[47.86595916748047,13.864559173583984,0],[47.573238372802734,13.68602466583252,0],[47.14305877685547,13.507193565368652,0],[47.08139789932187,13.4908435844417,0],[46.91499576591194,13.952649276016285,0],[46.53893499773435,14.113818176663823,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hadramaut","color":"#4055e0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Hadramaut, Hadhramaut, Hadramout, Hadramawt (Arabic: حَضْرَمَوْت‎, translit.

This period saw the rise of seven prime Lord Emperors (Ellarkku Nayanar – Lord of All) of Pandyan, who ruled the kingdom alongside Pandyan princes. Their power reached its zenith under Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan in the middle of the 13th century. The foundation for such a great empire was laid by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan early in the 13th century.\nThe Pandyan kingdom was replaced by the Chola princes who assumed the title as Chola Pandyas in the 11th century.[67] After being overshadowed by the Pallavas and Cholas for centuries, Pandyan glory was briefly revived by the much celebrated Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I in 1251 AD.[68]\n\nPandyan power extended from the Telugu countries on banks of the Godavari river to Sri Lanka, which was invaded by Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I in 1258 and on his behalf by his younger brother Jatavarman Vira Pandyan II from 1262 to 1264.[69] They ruled the whole peninsula and reduced the power of the Cholas and the Hoysala, also making Chera Nadu and Sri Lanka Pandyan provinces.[70] Later Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan appointed his brother to rule Kongu country, Chola country and Hoysala country.[71]\n\nThe marital alliance of Kulothunga Chola III and one of his successors, Rajaraja Chola III, with the Hoysalas did not yield any advantage in countering the Pandyan resurgence, who got defeated by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I, who after the victory burnt down Uraiyur and Thanjavur.[72] The Cholas renewed their control with the help of the Hoysalas under Hoysala king Vira Someshwara.[73] The later successor of Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I, Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II got defeated by Rajendra Chola III around 1250.[72]\n\nJatavarman Sundara Pandyan I subdued Rajendra Chola III in around 1258–1260 and was an equal antagonist of the Hoysalas whose presence he absolutely disliked in the Tamil country.[72] He first vanquished the Kadava Pallavas under Kopperunchinga II, who had challenged the Hoysala army stationed in and around Kanchipuram and killed a few of their commanders.\nAround 1260 dragged Jatavarman I first the Hoysalas into war by routing Vira Someshwara's son Ramanatha out of Tiruchirappalli. Vira Someshwara Hoysala, who had given the control of the empire to his sons tried to challenge Jatavarman. Between Samayapuram and Tiruchy, the armies of Vira Someshwara were routed with Vira Someshwara losing his life in this battle to Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I in Kannanur.[68][75]\n\nNext concentrated Jatavarman I on completely wiping out the Chola empire. Rajendra Chola III had been counting on Hoysala assistance in case he was challenged by the Pandyans, keeping in mind the earlier marital alliance of the Cholas with the Hoysalas. Initially, Jatavarman consolidated the Pandyan hold on Tiruchirappalli and Thiruvarangam and marched towards Thanjavur and Kumbakonam.[76] The Hoysala king Narasimha III joined hands with the Pandyans, opposing alliance with the Cholas.[73] When challenged by Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan, Rajendra III marched against the Pandyans between Tanjore and Tiruchy, hoping for assistance and participation in war from the Hoysalas. However, the already vanquished Hoysalas were in a defensive position. They did not want to go to war and risk yet another defeat by the resurgent Pandyans. Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan who defeated the Kadava Pallavas, Hoysalas and also the Telugu Choda, forced Rajendra III to become his tributary vassal.[77]\n\nJatavarman Sundara Pandiyan invaded Sri Lanka in 1258 and took control over Jaffna Kingdom by defeating the Javaka king Chandrabhanu, making the Javaka king paying tribute to him.[78] Chandrabhanu and two Sinhalese princes revolted against the Pandyans in 1270, and got his final defeat in 1270 by the brother of Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I, Jatavarman Vira Pandyan II.[79]\n\nAround 1279 was the combined force of Hoysala Ramanatha and Rajendra Chola III defeated by Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I, giving an ultimate end on the Chola dynasty.","privateMemo":"Polygon44_Pandyastate","show":true}},{"Position":[[[80.36532592773438,14.271071434020996,0],[80.37338256835938,13.908957481384277,0],[80.27955627441406,13.686388969421387,0],[80.38179016113281,13.540488243103027,0],[80.4055004842248,13.50865748528523,0],[80.52354431152344,13.35018539428711,0],[80.51712036132812,13.121453285217285,0],[80.42742156982422,12.848063468933105,0],[80.12647247314453,12.12313461303711,0],[80.07040792019772,11.986062996849936,0],[79.97301483154297,11.747947692871094,0],[79.92894345120735,11.532891058722637,0],[79.91439819335938,11.4619140625,0],[78.36329737011285,11.081789225701009,0],[78.23175810422931,11.757243691797289,0],[77.50913101810708,13.78059953293953,0],[77.65365643533153,14.214175784612866,0],[80.29073333740234,14.96340560913086,0],[80.36532592773438,14.271071434020996,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Chola state","color":"#4b89ea","image":"220px-Airavateswara_Temple,_Darasuram_in_Thanjavur_District.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Marital and political alliances between the Eastern Chalukyas began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi. Rajaraja Chola's daughter married Chalukya prince Vimaladitya[75] and Rajendra Chola's daughter Ammanga Devi was married to the Eastern Chalukya prince Rajaraja Narendra.[76] Virarajendra Chola's son, Athirajendra Chola, was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070, and Kulothunga Chola I, the son of Ammanga Devi and Rajaraja Narendra, ascended the Chola throne. Thus began the Later Chola dynasty.[77]\n\nThe Later Chola dynasty was led by capable rulers such as Kulothunga Chola I, his son Vikrama Chola, other successors like Rajaraja Chola II, Rajadhiraja Chola II, and Kulothunga Chola III, who conquered Kalinga, Ilam, and Kataha. However, the rule of the later Cholas between 1218, starting with Rajaraja Chola II, to the last emperor Rajendra Chola III was not as strong as those of the emperors between 850–1215. Around 1118, they lost control of Vengi to the Western Chalukya and Gangavadi (southern Mysore districts) to the Hoysala Empire. However, these were only temporary setbacks, because immediately following the accession of king Vikrama Chola, the son and successor of Kulothunga Chola I, the Cholas lost no time in recovering the province of Vengi by defeating Chalukya Someshvara III and also recovering Gangavadi from the Hoysalas. The Chola Empire, though not as strong as between 850–1150, was still largely territorially intact under Rajaraja Chola II (1146–1175) a fact attested by the construction and completion of the third grand Chola architectural marvel, the chariot-shaped Airavatesvara Temple at Dharasuram on the outskirts of modern Kumbakonam. Chola administration and territorial integrity until the rule of Kulothunga Chola III was stable and very prosperous up to 1215, but during his rule itself, the decline of the Chola power started following his defeat by Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan II in 1215–16.[78] Subsequently, the Cholas also lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power.\nIn continuation of the decline, also marked by the resurgence of the Pandyan dynasty as the most powerful rulers in South India, a lack of a controlling central administration in its erstwhile-Pandyan territories prompted a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy. Details of the Pandyan civil war and the role played by the Cholas and Sinhalas, are present in the Mahavamsa as well as the Pallavarayanpettai Inscriptions.[79][80]\n\nThe Cholas, under Rajaraja Chola III and later, his successor Rajendra Chola III, were quite weak and therefore, experienced continuous trouble. One feudatory, the Kadava chieftain Kopperunchinga I, even held Rajaraja Chola III as hostage for sometime.[81][82] At the close of the 12th century, the growing influence of the Hoysalas replaced the declining Chalukyas as the main player in the Kannada country, but they too faced constant trouble from the Seunas and the Kalachuris, who were occupying Chalukya capital because those empires were their new rivals. So naturally, the Hoysalas found it convenient to have friendly relations with the Cholas from the time of Kulothunga Chola III, who had defeated Hoysala Veera Ballala II, who had subsequent marital relations with the Chola monarch. This continued during the time of Rajaraja Chola III the son and successor of Kulothunga Chola III[78][83]\n\nThe Pandyas in the south had risen to the rank of a great power who ultimately banished the Hoysalas from Malanadu or Kannada country, who were allies of the Cholas from Tamil country and the demise of the Cholas themselves ultimately was caused by the Pandyas in 1279. The Pandyas first steadily gained control of the Tamil country as well as territories in Sri Lanka, Chera country, Telugu country under Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan II and his able successor Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan before inflicting several defeats on the joint forces of the Cholas under Rajaraja Chola III, his successor Rajendra Chola III and the Hoysalas under Someshwara, his son Ramanatha[78] Rajendra III tried to survive by aligning with the Kadava Pallavas and the Hoysalas in turn in order to counter the constantly rising power of the Pandyans who were the major players in the Tamil country from 1215 and had intelligently consolidated their position in Madurai-Rameswaram-Ilam-Cheranadu and Kanyakumari belt, and had been steadily increasing their territories in the Kaveri belt between Dindigul-Tiruchy-Karur-Satyamangalam as well as in the Kaveri Delta i.e., Thanjavur-Mayuram-Chidambaram-Vriddhachalam-Kanchi, finally marching all the way up to Arcot—Tirumalai-Nellore-Visayawadai-Vengi-Kalingam belt by 1250.\nThe Pandyas steadily routed both the Hoysalas and the Cholas.[85] They also dispossessed the Hoysalas, by defeating them under Jatavarman Sundara Pandiyan at Kannanur Kuppam.[86] At the close of Rajendra's reign, the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had taken the place of the Chola empire in the eyes of the foreign observers.[87] The last recorded date of Rajendra III is 1279. There is no evidence that Rajendra was followed immediately by another Chola prince.[88][89] The Hoysalas were routed from Kannanur Kuppam around 1279 by Kulasekhara Pandiyan and in the same war the last Chola emperor Rajendra III was routed and the Chola empire ceased to exist thereafter. Thus the Chola empire was completely overshadowed by the Pandyan empire and sank into obscurity and ceased to exist by the end of the 13th century.[82][89] However, only the Chola dynasty in India was extinguished but it survived elsewhere. According to Cebuano oral legends, a rebel branch of the Chola dynasty continued to survive in the Philippines up until the 16th Century, ruling a local Malayo-Tamil Indianized kingdom called the Rajahnate of Cebu which was founded by Rajamuda Sri Lumay Chola, born in Chola occupied Srivijaya.[90] The Chola ruled Indianized kingdom flourished until its eventual conquest by Conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who with his Spanish and Latino soldiers had sailed to the Philippines from Mexico.","privateMemo":"Polygon45_Cholastate","show":true}},{"Position":[[[84.50758992959156,20.768891186880182,0],[82.06551659464282,18.747165957174204,0],[79.53179547796313,17.24996711549984,0],[79.63560402166344,16.034452170525736,0],[80.66342163085938,15.790118217468262,0],[80.5038833618164,15.662714958190918,0],[80.36709594726562,15.40829086303711,0],[80.2930679321289,15.192127227783203,0],[80.29073333740234,14.96340560913086,0],[77.65365643533153,14.214175784612866,0],[77.50913101810708,13.78059953293953,0],[78.23175810422931,11.757243691797289,0],[78.36329737011285,11.081789225701009,0],[76.27872467041016,10.570927619934082,0],[75.85541534423828,11.440461158752441,0],[75.79436057392535,11.534489605081252,0],[75.41460418701172,12.119339942932129,0],[75.1654052734375,12.893933296203613,0],[74.98126152939653,13.544879121893334,0],[74.93728637695312,13.70033073425293,0],[74.90665315509612,13.768242492163738,0],[74.625100142163,14.39242626697626,0],[74.60517120361328,14.436607360839844,0],[74.58073794487179,14.478894581887264,0],[74.35679574322648,14.866476667560503,0],[74.23584747314453,15.075804710388184,0],[74.04509735107422,15.407447814941406,0],[73.77639770507812,16.054899215698242,0],[73.71171525888435,16.260928643049574,0],[73.69790095635621,16.304930578761862,0],[73.61295318603516,16.575510025024414,0],[73.59939843548813,16.633379501233897,0],[73.38837654760498,17.53429804474848,0],[73.26789093017578,18.048688888549805,0],[73.17977399630493,18.555538193539796,0],[73.05701446533203,19.26165199279785,0],[72.98617553710938,19.966659545898438,0],[72.9631576538086,20.074621200561523,0],[73.06809997558594,20.328954696655273,0],[73.31334686279297,20.70429229736328,0],[73.3165283203125,20.84406280517578,0],[73.13479614257812,20.97072982788086,0],[72.96939849853516,21.167327880859375,0],[72.91832733154297,21.453092575073242,0],[72.8696060180664,21.865915298461914,0],[72.89928436279297,22.1455078125,0],[72.52271270751953,22.132003784179688,0],[72.4366455078125,22.036523818969727,0],[72.33080291748047,21.845714569091797,0],[72.33470153808594,21.763151168823242,0],[72.45935821533203,21.64905548095703,0],[72.49266052246094,21.56654167175293,0],[72.4598617553711,21.369535446166992,0],[72.32452392578125,21.172311782836914,0],[72.09809112548828,21.006649017333984,0],[71.73258972167969,20.840702056884766,0],[71.50625610351562,20.789398193359375,0],[71.22811126708984,20.674448013305664,0],[71.0587158203125,20.667734146118164,0],[70.671142578125,20.79397201538086,0],[70.41361236572266,20.964950561523438,0],[69.95588684082031,21.415042877197266,0],[69.32972717285156,21.9854793548584,0],[69.09783935546875,22.302627563476562,0],[69.2178955078125,22.32193946838379,0],[69.69590759277344,22.26578140258789,0],[69.97283172607422,22.304479598999023,0],[70.17218780517578,22.36842918395996,0],[70.37986755371094,22.495927810668945,0],[70.61422729492188,22.769594192504883,0],[70.58431243896484,22.877532958984375,0],[70.51388549804688,22.84561538696289,0],[70.2496109008789,22.794233322143555,0],[69.8685531616211,22.806135177612305,0],[69.5954818725586,22.85637664794922,0],[69.31085968017578,22.915876388549805,0],[69.08607482910156,23.01412010192871,0],[73.39015662721039,24.69226853338518,0],[74.18504642194483,24.47548040754851,0],[74.4018345477815,23.96964144726295,0],[73.7514701702715,21.801760188896267,0],[73.96825829610816,21.512709354447374,0],[75.3412497597404,21.223658519998487,0],[79.31569873341266,21.87402289750849,0],[79.60474956786155,22.235336440569604,0],[79.60474956786155,23.391539778365164,0],[80.1105885281471,23.463802486977393,0],[80.68869019704489,23.31927706975295,0],[80.90547832288156,22.813438109467384,0],[82.20620707790158,22.885700818079613,0],[82.56752062096268,22.66891269224294,0],[83.36241041569714,21.584972063059595,0],[84.50758992959156,20.768891186880182,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"minor

The sultanate reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent.[10] This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, states such as the Vijayanagara Empire and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off.[11][12]\n\nDuring and in the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis of Indian civilization with that of Islamic civilization, and the further integration of the Indian subcontinent with a growing world system and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society, as well as the wider world.[13] The time of their rule included the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture,[14][15] increased growth rates in India's population and economy,[16] and the emergence of the Hindi-Urdu language.[17] The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol Empire's potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries.[18] However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.[19] In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.","privateMemo":"Polygon47_SultanateofDelhi\nデリー・スルターン朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[97.1867446899414,17.261205673217773,0],[97.08528137207031,17.362632751464844,0],[96.97404479980469,17.349679946899414,0],[96.93773651123047,16.904932022094727,0],[96.86656188964844,16.71419906616211,0],[96.67291259765625,16.52954864501953,0],[96.40756225585938,16.40192985534668,0],[95.9174575805664,16.17218589782715,0],[95.75598907470703,15.892321586608887,0],[95.62186431884766,15.758624076843262,0],[95.53347778320312,15.694902420043945,0],[95.4266357421875,15.821736335754395,0],[95.42385864257812,16.018661499023438,0],[95.32846069335938,16.012100219726562,0],[95.17630767822266,15.8529634475708,0],[95.03166961669922,15.85901165008545,0],[94.95707702636719,15.954141616821289,0],[95.02330780029297,16.176626205444336,0],[95.02294158935547,16.22744369506836,0],[94.7433853149414,16.15060806274414,0],[94.6192626953125,16.093175888061523,0],[94.50775146484375,15.965876579284668,0],[94.3480224609375,16.0227108001709,0],[94.3470230102539,16.232351303100586,0],[94.59566497802734,16.925331115722656,0],[94.66851806640625,17.281234741210938,0],[94.66897270362857,17.659783372849148,0],[94.66899871826172,17.68144416809082,0],[94.6241226196289,18.157785415649414,0],[94.4510726928711,18.595752716064453,0],[94.25737762451172,19.078121185302734,0],[94.16925048828125,19.211328506469727,0],[94.0427017211914,18.969663619995117,0],[93.89833068847656,19.026525497436523,0],[93.66160583496094,19.191184997558594,0],[93.87866973876953,19.267885208129883,0],[94.01866149902344,19.274532318115234,0],[93.95149993896484,19.49036979675293,0],[93.92748260498047,19.61100959777832,0],[93.61965942382812,19.95973014831543,0],[93.5379867553711,20.042144775390625,0],[93.4521484375,20.054664611816406,0],[93.26929473876953,20.00980567932129,0],[93.09809112548828,20.130138397216797,0],[93.13694763183594,20.32714080810547,0],[93.1251449584961,20.390644073486328,0],[93.03076171875,20.441259384155273,0],[92.866455078125,20.421857833862305,0],[92.60701751708984,20.63093376159668,0],[92.37995910644531,20.903606414794922,0],[92.32733154296875,21.013402938842773,0],[92.27052307128906,21.132062911987305,0],[92.14971160888672,21.37955093383789,0],[92.04956817626953,21.925642013549805,0],[91.77473449707031,22.560285568237305,0],[91.61383819580078,22.73780632019043,0],[91.92025990595477,24.11031274346304,0],[92.23768167892861,25.443200230009786,0],[94.9244437936528,25.99299728840519,0],[98.79569518764482,25.77512362738674,0],[98.7863109532533,25.417852743017026,0],[100.70546048263063,24.330954990324063,0],[100.34414693956951,23.391539778365168,0],[101.21129944291619,21.440446645835152,0],[100.43160644701217,20.406028283931963,0],[100.20481872558594,20.475622177124023,0],[100.1690444946289,20.437313079833984,0],[100.04484166533084,20.498836922489154,0],[98.87366231010162,18.414223414266093,0],[97.77688598632812,16.4620418548584,0],[97.62213897705078,16.499820709228516,0],[97.55565643310547,16.544143676757812,0],[97.41865539550781,16.95677947998047,0],[97.1867446899414,17.261205673217773,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Pagan","color":"#e06b39","image":"Tharaba_Gate.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The Kingdom of Pagan (Burmese: ပုဂံခေတ်, pronounced [bəɡàɴ kʰɪʔ], lit. \"Pagan Period\"; also commonly known as the Pagan Dynasty and the Pagan Empire) was the first kingdom to unify the regions that would later constitute modern-day Burma (Myanmar). Pagan's 250-year rule over the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery laid the foundation for the ascent of Burmese language and culture, the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma, and the growth of Theravada Buddhism in Burma and in mainland Southeast Asia.[1]\n\nThe kingdom grew out of a small 9th-century settlement at Pagan (Bagan) by the Mranma (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the Kingdom of Nanzhao. Over the next two hundred years, the small principality gradually grew to absorb its surrounding regions until the 1050s and 1060s when King Anawrahta founded the Pagan Empire, for the first time unifying under one polity the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. By the late 12th century Anawrahta's successors had extended their influence farther to the south into the upper Malay peninsula, to the east at least to the Salween river, in the farther north to below the current China border, and to the west, in northern Arakan and the Chin Hills.[2][3] In the 12th and 13th centuries, Pagan, alongside the Khmer Empire, was one of two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia.[4]\n\nThe Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, Mon and Pali norms by the late 12th century. Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level although Tantric, Mahayana, Brahmanic, and animist practices remained heavily entrenched at all social strata. Pagan's rulers built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone of which over 2000 remain. The wealthy donated tax-free land to religious authorities.[5]\n\nThe kingdom went into decline in the mid-13th century as the continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth by the 1280s had severely affected the crown's ability to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen. This ushered in a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges by the Arakanese, Mons, Mongols and Shans. Repeated Mongol invasions (1277–1301) toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287. The collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century.","privateMemo":"Polygon48_Pagan\nパガン王朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[107.22139797435831,15.039426223295823,0],[106.26968904577178,14.503226619061756,0],[106.07940813056852,14.480650917257979,0],[105.9806382113229,15.442641831020651,0],[105.13669708214886,17.46785468081627,0],[104.31494969295545,18.015686273611884,0],[101.8497075253752,18.015686273611884,0],[101.86103111751045,19.678142439750353,0],[102.05514437267355,20.549407390291577,0],[103.18362296425926,20.983437617824542,0],[105.61604972584502,21.918986372280603,0],[106.43779711503844,21.71354952498225,0],[107.6694564819336,20.993242263793945,0],[107.5780029296875,20.897764205932617,0],[107.01070404052734,20.921977996826172,0],[106.94991302490234,20.832921981811523,0],[106.97523498535156,20.65511131286621,0],[106.84795379638672,20.48333740234375,0],[106.58458709716797,20.127059936523438,0],[106.48509216308594,20.063329696655273,0],[106.2453384399414,19.954822540283203,0],[106.16853332519531,19.89749526977539,0],[106.04705047607422,19.71938133239746,0],[105.91062927246094,19.29985237121582,0],[105.73624420166016,18.861183166503906,0],[105.85697937011719,18.759807586669922,0],[106.06779479980469,18.506168365478516,0],[106.56810760498047,18.02446937561035,0],[106.578857421875,17.916507720947266,0],[106.59750366210938,17.68151092529297,0],[106.63672637939453,17.567251205444336,0],[106.82592010498047,17.345327377319336,0],[107.2087391518182,17.054942464466286,0],[106.99231613189401,16.38205704297955,0],[107.06457884050624,15.514904539632877,0],[107.22139797435831,15.039426223295823,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Annam","color":"#b44f88","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Annam (Chinese: 安南; pinyin: Ānnán; Vietnamese: An Nam) was the southernmost province of China after the Tang dynasty.

Under Suryavarman II (reigned 1113–1150) the kingdom united internally[11]:113 and the largest temple of Angkor was built in a period of 37 years: Angkor Wat, dedicated to the god Vishnu. In the east, his campaigns against Champa, and Dai Viet, were unsuccessful,[11]:114 though he did sack Vijaya in 1145 and depose Jaya Indravarman III.[29]:75–76 The Khmers occupied Vijaya until 1149, when they were driven out by Jaya Harivarman I.[8]:160 Suryavarman II sent a mission to the Chola dynasty of south India and presented a precious stone to the Chola Emperor Kulottunga Chola I in 1114.[30][31]\n\nAnother period followed in which kings reigned briefly and were violently overthrown by their successors. Finally, in 1177 the capital was raided and looted in a naval battle on the Tonlé Sap lake by a Cham fleet under Jaya Indravarman IV, and Tribhuvanadityavarman was killed.\n\nKing Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181–1219) was generally considered as Cambodia's greatest king. He had already been a military leader as a prince under previous kings. After the Cham had conquered Angkor, he gathered an army and regained the capital. He ascended the throne and continued the war against the neighbouring eastern kingdom for another 22 years, until the Khmer defeated Champa in 1203 and conquered large parts of its territory.[8]:170–171[29]:79–80\n\nJayavarman VII stands as the last of the great kings of Angkor, not only because of his successful war against the Cham, but also because he was not a tyrannical ruler in the manner of his immediate predecessors. He unified the empire and carried out noteworthy building projects. The new capital, now called Angkor Thom (literally: \"Great City\"), was built. In the centre, the king (himself a follower of Mahayana Buddhism) had constructed as the state temple the Bayon,[9]:378–382 with towers bearing faces of the boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara, each several metres high, carved out of stone. Further important temples built under Jayavarman VII were Ta Prohm for his mother, Preah Khan for his father,[9]:388–389 Banteay Kdei, and Neak Pean, as well as the reservoir of Srah Srang. An extensive network of roads was laid down connecting every town of the empire, with rest-houses built for travelers and a total of 102 hospitals established across his realm.[8]:173,176\n\nJayavarman VIII — the last blooming\nAfter the death of Jayavarman VII, his son Indravarman II (reigned 1219–1243) ascended the throne.[8]:180–181 Like his father, he was a Buddhist, and he completed a series of temples begun under his father's rule. As a warrior he was less successful. In the year 1220, under mounting pressure from increasingly powerful Đại Việt, and its Cham alliance, the Khmer withdrew from many of the provinces previously conquered from Champa. In the west, his Thai subjects rebelled, establishing the first Thai kingdom at Sukhothai and pushing back the Khmer. In the following 200 years, the Thais would become the chief rivals of Kambuja.\n\nIndravarman II was succeeded by Jayavarman VIII (reigned 1243–1295). In contrast to his predecessors, Jayavarman VIII was a follower of Hindu Shaivism and an aggressive opponent of Buddhism, destroying many Buddha statues in the empire and converting Buddhist temples to Hindu temples.[11]:133 From the outside, the empire was threatened in 1283 by the Mongols under Kublai Khan's general Sogetu (sometimes known as Sagatu or Sodu), who was the governor of Guangzhou, China.[32] The king avoided war with his powerful opponent, who ruled all of China, by paying annual tribute, starting in 1285.[8]:192[32] Jayavarman VIII's rule ended in 1295 when he was deposed by his son-in-law Srindravarman (reigned 1295–1309). The new king was a follower of Theravada Buddhism, a school of Buddhism that had arrived in southeast Asia from Sri Lanka and subsequently spread through most of the region.\n\nIn August 1296, the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan arrived at Angkor and recorded, \"In the recent war with the Siamese, the country was utterly devastated.\"[8]:211[29]:90 He remained at the court of King Srindravarman until July 1297. He was neither the first nor the last Chinese representative to visit Kambuja. His stay is notable, however, because Zhou Daguan later wrote a detailed report on life in Angkor. His portrayal is today one of the most important sources of understanding historical Angkor. Alongside descriptions of several great temples (the Bayon, the Baphuon, Angkor Wat) – his account informs us that the towers of the Bayon were once covered in gold – the text also offers valuable information on the everyday life and the habits of the inhabitants of Angkor.","privateMemo":"Polygon50_KhmerEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[107.89568328857422,16.388399124145508,0],[108.01283264160156,16.299715042114258,0],[108.29901123046875,16.2685604095459,0],[108.43981170654297,16.097352981567383,0],[108.56672668457031,15.640241622924805,0],[108.70260620117188,15.38007926940918,0],[108.98978424072266,15.10753059387207,0],[109.12142944335938,14.809234619140625,0],[109.27481079101562,14.186997413635254,0],[109.51078796386719,12.923304557800293,0],[109.37820434570312,12.726065635681152,0],[109.2720947265625,12.503484725952148,0],[109.29460906982422,12.135061264038086,0],[109.25209045410156,11.950740814208984,0],[109.27701568603516,11.652194023132324,0],[109.26496887207031,11.607699394226074,0],[109.14697109061004,11.429172582401229,0],[107.71494321801624,11.684980983185064,0],[107.58816528320312,12.371047973632812,0],[107.68592834472656,12.600295066833496,0],[107.66148376464844,13.082886695861816,0],[107.6839599609375,13.273574829101562,0],[107.71825408935547,13.438924789428711,0],[107.51336669921875,13.895018577575684,0],[107.50041198730469,14.193450927734375,0],[107.22139797435831,15.039426223295823,0],[107.06457884050624,15.514904539632877,0],[106.99231613189401,16.38205704297955,0],[107.2087391518182,17.054942464466286,0],[107.31863403320312,16.971582412719727,0],[107.89568328857422,16.388399124145508,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Champa","color":"#fa929a","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Champa","privateMemo":"Polygon51_Champa","show":true}},{"Position":[[[101.11237335205078,13.464309692382812,0],[100.78911590576172,13.489026069641113,0],[100.67759704589844,13.52690315246582,0],[100.44334411621094,13.507344245910645,0],[100.24366760253906,13.411622047424316,0],[100.13399505615234,13.277973175048828,0],[100.05509610512061,13.925124950163973,0],[100.41640964818174,14.214175784612866,0],[100.84998589985507,14.214175784612866,0],[101.13903673430397,14.06965036738842,0],[101.11237335205078,13.464309692382812,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Luva","color":"#a0eb7c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Luva","privateMemo":"Polygon52_Luva","show":true}},{"Position":[[[83.94362195054356,28.221813467859356,0],[80.25764471256966,29.998507532206496,0],[80.01122730380531,30.726204702505786,0],[80.01122730380531,31.177846631332176,0],[80.28221246110115,31.900473717454403,0],[80.01122730380531,33.074742732403024,0],[80.1015556895706,34.06835497582109,0],[81.45648147604977,34.06835497582109,0],[81.99845179064144,34.519996904647485,0],[81.99828768772949,34.785019656142666,0],[82.89703779748044,34.760283414589885,0],[87.02469983483499,35.128824667925116,0],[90.12044636285091,35.202532918592155,0],[90.4152793655191,35.64478242259443,0],[90.12044636285091,36.01332367592966,0],[90.78382061885432,36.52928143059898,0],[91.88944437886002,36.381864929264886,0],[95.72227341354639,37.11894743593535,0],[101.89123470685396,36.32435270840642,0],[102.60976481078157,33.737644334267,0],[100.8852925613553,28.707933606773693,0],[98.84088897705078,27.49571418762207,0],[98.75436735010061,28.30540396399632,0],[97.8149521381417,28.955768341506325,0],[95.28575733671391,28.738980215669656,0],[92.03393544916389,27.293726043425202,0],[88.86740610151114,26.431251089213717,0],[86.43503382949862,27.020917094550082,0],[83.94362195054356,28.221813467859356,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Tibet","color":"#ff8040","image":"300px-Gyantse_Dzong4.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Between 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty.

In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.","privateMemo":"Polygon53_Tibet","show":true}},{"Position":[[[67.95183752922829,28.41146932922306,0],[68.44016108727313,29.389344593179658,0],[70.02994067674203,31.774013977383014,0],[71.21163670058543,33.071562552583615,0],[71.87263974635371,33.79736981852526,0],[72.99493496356621,34.24176856781277,0],[73.02884308414927,34.08642065297415,0],[73.31789391859816,33.2915308582397,0],[73.67920746165927,33.00248002379081,0],[80.25764471256966,29.998507532206496,0],[83.94362195054356,28.221813467859356,0],[86.43503382949862,27.020917094550082,0],[88.86740610151114,26.431251089213717,0],[91.02225752859276,25.703946453956295,0],[90.37189315108276,25.342632910895183,0],[90.22736773385832,24.981319367834068,0],[90.76776123046875,22.99646759033203,0],[90.69905853271484,22.939149856567383,0],[90.68743133544922,22.69773292541504,0],[90.85551452636719,22.342363357543945,0],[90.85303497314453,22.15178108215332,0],[90.78889465332031,22.07541847229004,0],[90.58412170410156,22.036876678466797,0],[90.47822570800781,21.795255661010742,0],[90.36073303222656,21.750545501708984,0],[90.24607849121094,21.94722557067871,0],[90.10635375976562,22.124797821044922,0],[90.07334899902344,22.15019989013672,0],[90,21.849040985107422,0],[89.87384033203125,21.7368106842041,0],[89.7826156616211,21.717554092407227,0],[89.6602783203125,21.95868492126465,0],[89.43754577636719,21.672353744506836,0],[89.27591705322266,21.791311264038086,0],[89.19843292236328,21.646448135375977,0],[89.22920227050781,21.563932418823242,0],[89.08460235595703,21.531858444213867,0],[88.9271240234375,21.55692481994629,0],[88.86064147949219,21.874412536621094,0],[88.7712631225586,21.912338256835938,0],[88.65754699707031,21.753286361694336,0],[88.58071899414062,21.594308853149414,0],[88.50323486328125,21.568742752075195,0],[88.45159149169922,21.613094329833984,0],[88.32527160644531,21.879623413085938,0],[88.25670623779297,21.955713272094727,0],[88.07115173339844,21.713932037353516,0],[87.8443832397461,21.580053329467773,0],[87.39790344238281,21.401227951049805,0],[87.14086151123047,21.305400848388672,0],[87.0223617553711,21.203506469726562,0],[86.9998550415039,21.15264129638672,0],[87.0478744506836,20.892288208007812,0],[87.12977600097656,20.70823097229004,0],[86.97887420654297,20.485572814941406,0],[86.84151458740234,20.336078643798828,0],[86.83604431152344,20.220619201660156,0],[86.58928680419922,20.033716201782227,0],[86.32283020019531,19.823514938354492,0],[86.11260986328125,19.740480422973633,0],[85.91844177246094,19.71465492248535,0],[85.58277130126953,19.622346878051758,0],[84.88799563655314,20.22945304338388,0],[84.50758992959156,20.768891186880182,0],[83.36241041569714,21.584972063059595,0],[82.56752062096268,22.66891269224294,0],[82.20620707790158,22.885700818079613,0],[80.90547832288156,22.813438109467384,0],[80.68869019704489,23.31927706975295,0],[80.1105885281471,23.463802486977393,0],[79.60474956786155,23.391539778365164,0],[79.60474956786155,22.235336440569604,0],[79.31569873341266,21.87402289750849,0],[75.3412497597404,21.223658519998487,0],[73.96825829610816,21.512709354447374,0],[73.7514701702715,21.801760188896267,0],[74.4018345477815,23.96964144726295,0],[74.18504642194483,24.47548040754851,0],[73.39015662721039,24.69226853338518,0],[69.08607482910156,23.01412010192871,0],[68.99447631835938,23.045696258544922,0],[68.57660675048828,23.343387603759766,0],[68.27584075927734,23.69215965270996,0],[68.25066375732422,23.781042098999023,0],[67.89598846435547,23.831127166748047,0],[67.68968963623047,23.945032119750977,0],[67.5195541381836,24.1098575592041,0],[67.40789794921875,24.605138778686523,0],[67.35726165771484,24.668563842773438,0],[67.20320129394531,24.731754302978516,0],[66.90538024902344,24.769250869750977,0],[66.85787963867188,24.800907135009766,0],[66.85177612304688,24.92159652709961,0],[66.90416717529297,25.131351470947266,0],[66.82417297363281,25.334457397460938,0],[66.63599395751953,25.505582809448242,0],[66.50375366210938,25.511659622192383,0],[67.95183752922829,28.41146932922306,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Timurid Emirates","color":"#d89ab3","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Timur conquered large parts of Central Asia, primarily Transoxiana and Khorasan, from 1363 onwards with various alliances (Samarkand in 1366, and Balkh in 1369), and was recognized as ruler over them in 1370. Acting officially in the name of Suurgatmish, the Chagatai khan, he subjugated Transoxania and Khwarazm in the years that followed. Already in the 1360s he had gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate and while as emir he was nominally subordinate to the khan, in reality it was now Timur that picked the khans who became mere puppet rulers. The western Chagatai khans were continually dominated by Timurid princes in the 15th and 16th centuries and their figurehead importance was eventually reduced into total insignificance.\nTimur began a campaign westwards in 1380, invading the various successor states of the Ilkhanate. By 1389, he had removed the Kartids from Herat and advanced into mainland Persia where he enjoyed many successes. This included the capture of Isfahan in 1387, the removal of the Muzaffarids from Shiraz in 1393, and the expulsion of the Jalayirids from Baghdad. In 1394–95, he triumphed over the Golden Horde, following his successful campaign in Georgia, after which he enforced his sovereignty in the Caucasus. Tokhtamysh, the khan of the Golden Horde, was a major rival to Timur in the region. He also subjugated Multan and Dipalpur in modern-day Pakistan in 1398. Timur gave the north Indian territories to a non-family member, Khizr Khan, whose Sayyid dynasty replaced the defeated Tughlaq dynasty of the Sultanate of Delhi.[citation needed] Delhi became a vassal of the Timurids but obtained independence in the years following the death of Timur.[citation needed][dubious – discuss] In 1400–1401 he conquered Aleppo, Damascus and eastern Anatolia, in 1401 he destroyed Baghdad and in 1402 defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara. This made Timur the most preeminent Muslim ruler of the time, as the Ottoman Empire plunged into civil war. Meanwhile, he transformed Samarkand into a major capital and seat of his realm.","privateMemo":"Polygon54_TimuridEmirates\nティムール朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[72.99493496356621,34.24176856781277,0],[74.86283847477245,34.98140816659102,0],[76.21743510166361,35.51360914806555,0],[78.65630151732614,35.15229560500443,0],[81.45648147604977,35.33295237653499,0],[81.99828768772949,34.785019656142666,0],[81.99845179064144,34.519996904647485,0],[81.45648147604977,34.06835497582109,0],[80.1015556895706,34.06835497582109,0],[80.01122730380531,33.074742732403024,0],[80.28221246110115,31.900473717454403,0],[80.01122730380531,31.177846631332176,0],[80.01122730380531,30.726204702505786,0],[80.25764471256966,29.998507532206496,0],[73.67920746165927,33.00248002379081,0],[73.31789391859816,33.2915308582397,0],[73.02884308414927,34.08642065297415,0],[72.99493496356621,34.24176856781277,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Kashmir and Ladakh","color":"#37d6fb","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Kashmir and Ladakh","privateMemo":"Polygon55_KashmirandLadakh\nラダック","show":true}},{"Position":[[[60.22931082120931,42.378566466226715,0],[63.75211786605517,45.26907481071564,0],[70.70740356998162,50.146807642040685,0],[79.37892860344837,49.42418055591845,0],[82.6307504909984,49.604837327449005,0],[85.88257237854842,50.327464413571235,0],[88.59242395150679,50.41779279933652,0],[91.04878163073383,50.09027844210624,0],[94.0121270974235,49.69516571321428,0],[93.47015678283182,49.153195398622614,0],[94.0121270974235,48.61122508403094,0],[94.0121270974235,48.06925476943927,0],[91.0312903671693,46.44334382566426,0],[91.12161875293458,43.91414902423645,0],[92.20555938211793,41.926924537400325,0],[81.45648147604977,35.33295237653499,0],[78.65630151732614,35.15229560500443,0],[76.21743510166361,35.51360914806555,0],[74.86283847477245,34.98140816659102,0],[72.99493496356621,34.24176856781277,0],[71.87263974635371,33.79736981852526,0],[71.21163670058543,33.071562552583615,0],[70.02994067674203,31.774013977383014,0],[68.08788038278854,36.868534934544726,0],[67.54591006819687,37.22984847760584,0],[66.91361136783992,37.22984847760584,0],[66.73295459630937,38.13313233525862,0],[64.83605849523852,38.85575942138085,0],[63.93277463758573,39.48805812173781,0],[62.30686369381072,40.39134197939059,0],[62.21653530804544,41.204297451278094,0],[61.313251450392656,41.204297451278094,0],[60.22931082120931,42.378566466226715,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Chagatai Khanate","color":"#5b7acc","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Chagatai Khanate (Mongolian: Цагаадайн Хаант Улс Tsagadaina Khaanat Ulus) was a Mongol and later Turkicized khanate[6][7] that comprised the lands ruled by Chagatai Khan,[8] second son of Genghis Khan, and his descendants and successors. Initially it was a part of the Mongol Empire, but it became a functionally separate khanate with the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire after 1259. The Chagatai Khanate recognized the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty in 1304,[9] but became split into two parts in the mid-14th century: the Western Chagatai Khanate and the Moghulistan Khanate.\n\nAt its height in the late 13th century, the Khanate extended from the Amu Darya south of the Aral Sea to the Altai Mountains in the border of modern-day Mongolia and China.[10]\n\nThe khanate lasted in one form or another from 1220s until the late 17th century, although the western half of the khanate was lost to Timur's empire by 1370. The eastern half remained under Chagatai khans, who were, at times, allied or at war with Timur's successors, the Timurid dynasty.

His realm was, by this point, isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of modern-day China and its surrounding areas, including modern Mongolia.[8] It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368, after which the rebuked Genghisid rulers retreated to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.[9] Some of the Mongolian Emperors of the Yuan mastered the Chinese language, while others only used their native language (i.e. Mongolian) and the 'Phags-pa script.[10]\n\nThe Yuan dynasty was the khanate ruled by the successors of Möngke Khan after the division of the Mongol Empire. In official Chinese histories, the Yuan dynasty bore the Mandate of Heaven. The dynasty was established by Kublai Khan, yet he placed his grandfather Genghis Khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as Taizu.[note 3] In the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name,[2] Kublai announced the name of the new dynasty as Great Yuan and claimed the succession of former Chinese dynasties from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Tang dynasty.[2]\n\nIn addition to Emperor of China, Kublai Khan also claimed the title of Great Khan, supreme over the other successor khanates: the Chagatai, the Golden Horde, and the Ilkhanate. As such, the Yuan was also sometimes referred to as the Empire of the Great Khan. However, while the claim of supremacy by the Yuan emperors was at times recognized by the western khans, their subservience was nominal and each continued its own separate development.","privateMemo":"Polygon57_GreatKhanate","show":true}},{"Position":[[[19.668676376342773,63.497676849365234,0],[19.521888732910156,63.46179962158203,0],[19.279590606689453,63.2194709777832,0],[18.98865509033203,63.15498352050781,0],[18.690288543701172,62.99821472167969,0],[18.592613220214844,62.87034606933594,0],[18.506855010986328,62.806396484375,0],[18.171104431152344,62.791595458984375,0],[18.07183265686035,62.80559158325195,0],[18.13991928100586,62.56497573852539,0],[17.921775817871094,62.37370681762695,0],[17.49390411376953,62.45769500732422,0],[17.591026306152344,62.21773910522461,0],[17.700435638427734,62.105072021484375,0],[17.59063720703125,61.67540740966797,0],[17.36630630493164,61.64687728881836,0],[17.268840789794922,61.55535125732422,0],[17.353853225708008,61.21467971801758,0],[17.349872589111328,60.96979904174805,0],[17.521291732788086,60.770042419433594,0],[17.392162322998047,60.69126510620117,0],[17.80862808227539,60.654510498046875,0],[17.910120010375977,60.570552825927734,0],[18.13441276550293,60.60728073120117,0],[18.428050994873047,60.33993911743164,0],[18.620529174804688,60.1985969543457,0],[19.007749557495117,60.125370025634766,0],[19.09673500061035,59.94266128540039,0],[19.24098777770996,59.88021469116211,0],[19.247215270996094,59.72939682006836,0],[19.071556091308594,59.72939682006836,0],[18.842914581298828,59.583900451660156,0],[18.45508575439453,59.448909759521484,0],[18.233747482299805,59.37625503540039,0],[17.998947143554688,59.381446838378906,0],[17.933616638183594,59.43333435058594,0],[17.57164764404297,59.48523712158203,0],[17.274261474609375,59.5631217956543,0],[16.98920249938965,59.59428787231445,0],[16.927753448486328,59.547542572021484,0],[16.726871490478516,59.5994873046875,0],[16.61124038696289,59.46446990966797,0],[16.980138778686523,59.495628356933594,0],[17.20349884033203,59.37625503540039,0],[17.46944236755371,59.355506896972656,0],[17.561786651611328,59.262149810791016,0],[17.77858543395996,59.23104476928711,0],[17.788076400756836,59.2880859375,0],[18.06539535522461,59.25696563720703,0],[18.181299209594727,59.345123291015625,0],[18.31504249572754,59.33994674682617,0],[18.53183364868164,59.38663864135742,0],[18.633224487304688,59.350318908691406,0],[18.645034790039062,59.417762756347656,0],[18.719133377075195,59.417762756347656,0],[18.814990997314453,59.350318908691406,0],[18.80185890197754,59.31401443481445,0],[18.477035522460938,59.30363845825195,0],[18.575624465942383,59.174041748046875,0],[18.219331741333008,59.05488204956055,0],[18.143800735473633,58.92546081542969,0],[17.970129013061523,58.88924026489258,0],[17.930086135864258,58.930633544921875,0],[17.948863983154297,59.00310134887695,0],[17.942771911621094,59.12739562988281,0],[17.826845169067383,59.117042541503906,0],[17.785852432250977,58.90993881225586,0],[17.560338973999023,58.75994110107422,0],[17.449052810668945,58.73408889770508,0],[17.286663055419922,58.765106201171875,0],[17.284395217895508,58.666900634765625,0],[16.646530151367188,58.65139389038086,0],[16.71685791015625,58.44508743286133,0],[16.947708129882812,58.328922271728516,0],[16.977209091186523,58.054874420166016,0],[16.92824935913086,57.90629577636719,0],[16.801427841186523,57.883426666259766,0],[16.66319465637207,57.91217803955078,0],[16.680194854736328,57.71910095214844,0],[16.810869216918945,57.68278503417969,0],[16.75414276123047,57.5621223449707,0],[16.862342834472656,57.459922790527344,0],[16.69782257080078,57.295894622802734,0],[16.598188400268555,57.09127426147461,0],[16.579837799072266,56.839393615722656,0],[16.26681440159225,56.41321126506121,0],[15.630657126335688,56.78271286989617,0],[14.688644062853605,56.69707531867053,0],[14.37907588781496,56.829774947596746,0],[13.63611226772221,56.54084465089401,0],[13.429733484363112,57.118705244299484,0],[13.099527430988557,56.99487797428402,0],[12.934424404301279,57.44891129767404,0],[12.728045620942181,57.40763554100222,0],[12.521666837583084,57.69656583770495,0],[12.080286026000977,57.34217834472656,0],[12.08477783203125,57.525936126708984,0],[11.969748497009277,57.68965148925781,0],[11.940039981093523,57.71518069247779,0],[12.69155925029689,58.57989147544779,0],[12.626436233520508,60.05575180053711,0],[12.639524459838867,60.29507064819336,0],[12.751622200012207,60.450843811035156,0],[12.63469409942627,60.642818450927734,0],[12.377702713012695,60.9733772277832,0],[12.801045417785645,61.04559326171875,0],[12.995400428771973,61.346920013427734,0],[13.358563367959658,62.04119910351319,0],[15.253316666247693,63.54272706977045,0],[16.864373098680115,63.772877988689366,0],[17.464567288841188,64.22302363131017,0],[21.076937192394393,64.04979445414868,0],[21.070144653320312,64.04258728027344,0],[20.90432357788086,63.83509826660156,0],[20.188549041748047,63.53424072265625,0],[19.873939514160156,63.405513763427734,0],[19.668676376342773,63.497676849365234,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Sweden","color":"#3ee182","image":"220px-Bildsten_med_skepp_800-1099_Tjängvide,_Gotland.jpg","religion":"","memo":"It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the 6th century. Götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of Östergötland (East Gothia) and Västergötland (West Gothia). The island of Gotland was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). Småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces (Scania, Blekinge and Halland). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohuslän. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland.\nDuring the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, Ystad in the Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.[23] In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.\nSt Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century.

Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the 6th century. Götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of Östergötland (East Gothia) and Västergötland (West Gothia). The island of Gotland was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). Småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces (Scania, Blekinge and Halland). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohuslän. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland.\nDuring the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, Ystad in the Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.[23] In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.\nSt Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms.

Poland's first historically documented ruler, Mieszko I, accepted Christianity with the Baptism of Poland in 966, as the new official religion of his subjects. The bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries. In 1000, Boleslaw the Brave, continuing the policy of his father Mieszko, held a Congress of Gniezno and created the metropolis of Gniezno and the dioceses of Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław. However, the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer.\nIn 1109, Prince Bolesław III Wrymouth defeated the King of Germany Henry V at the Battle of Hundsfeld, stopping the German march into Poland. The significance of the event was documented by Gallus Anonymus in his 1118 chronicle.[35] In 1138, Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when Bolesław divided his lands among his sons. In 1226, Konrad I of Masovia, one of the regional Piast dukes, invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans; a decision that led to centuries of warfare with the Knights. In 1264, the Statute of Kalisz or the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous right for the Jews in Poland, leading to a nearly autonomous \"nation within a nation\".[36]\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty (Henry I the Bearded and Henry II the Pious, ruled 1238–41) nearly succeeded in uniting the Polish lands, but the Mongols invaded the country from the east and defeated the combined Polish forces at the Battle of Legnica where Duke Henry II the Pious died. In 1320, after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms, Władysław I consolidated his power, took the throne and became the first king of a reunified Poland. His son, Casimir III (reigned 1333–70), has a reputation as one of the greatest Polish kings, and gained wide recognition for improving the country's infrastructure.[37][38] He also extended royal protection to Jews, and encouraged their immigration to Poland.[37][39] Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to create an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when Pope Urban V granted him permission to open the University of Kraków.\nThe Golden Liberty of the nobles began to develop under Casimir's rule, when in return for their military support, the king made a series of concessions to the nobility, and establishing their legal status as superior to that of the townsmen. When Casimir the Great died in 1370, leaving no legitimate male heir, the Piast dynasty came to an end.\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, Poland became a destination for German, Flemish and to a lesser extent Walloon, Danish and Scottish migrants. Also, Jews and Armenians began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era (see History of the Jews in Poland and Armenians in Poland).\n\nThe Black Death, a plague that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not significantly affect Poland, and the country was spared from a major outbreak of the disease.[40][41] The reason for this was the decision of Casimir the Great to quarantine the nation's borders.","privateMemo":"Polygon60_Poland","show":true}},{"Position":[[[21.97172735192973,49.76064970532274,0],[21.974342417306637,49.759952354555566,0],[21.974342417306637,49.60867726099148,0],[21.97172735192973,49.76064970532274,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Imperial Hungary","color":"#ebe989","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Imperial Hungary","privateMemo":"Polygon61_ImperialHungary","show":false}},{"Position":[[[22.437918329362333,54.14406221780768,0],[22.386586175142135,54.5547194515693,0],[22.283921866701732,54.606051605789496,0],[22.33525402092193,54.8113802226703,0],[22.129925404041124,54.96537668533091,0],[22.232589712481527,55.27336961065212,0],[21.873264632940113,55.53003038175313,0],[21.513939553398703,55.53003038175313,0],[21.34546166904949,56.144271138960676,0],[22.108165103419566,56.367011303058725,0],[22.949093044018063,56.367011303058725,0],[24.918619381702662,56.35739654798023,0],[25.511061239176854,56.50550701234878,0],[26.449094180177653,55.91306515487459,0],[27.574196717309803,55.736315347609846,0],[27.50480144308293,55.3692988984276,0],[27.89663133268637,54.977469008824166,0],[27.89663133268637,54.520334137620154,0],[27.30888649828121,53.932589303214996,0],[27.243581516680642,52.9530145792064,0],[26.329311774272615,52.75709963440468,0],[26.002786866269755,52.29996476320068,0],[23.586502547048553,52.365269744801246,0],[22.80284276784168,52.9530145792064,0],[22.437918329362333,54.14406221780768,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Lithuania","color":"#de9364","image":"150px-Seal_of_Mindaugas.jpg","religion":"","memo":"From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the Vikings,[28] and the kings of Denmark collected tribute at times.[citation needed] During the 10–11th centuries, Lithuanian territories were among the lands paying tribute to Kievan Rus', and Yaroslav the Wise was among the Ruthenian rulers who invaded Lithuania (from 1040). From the mid-12th century, it was the Lithuanians who were invading Ruthenian territories. In 1183, Polotsk and Pskov were ravaged, and even the distant and powerful Novgorod Republic was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging Lithuanian war machine toward the end of the 12th century.[29]\n\nFrom the late 12th century, an organized Lithuanian military force existed; it was used for external raids, plundering and the gathering of slaves. Such military and pecuniary activities fostered social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania. This initiated the formation of early statehood, from which the Grand Duchy of Lithuania developed.[30]\n\nInitially inhabited by fragmented Baltic tribes, in the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas, who was crowned as King of Lithuania on 6 July 1253.[31] After his assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order. Siege of Pilėnai is noted for the Lithuanians' heroic defense against the intruders. Despite the devastating century-long struggle with the Orders, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded rapidly, overtaking former Slavic principalities of Kievan Rus'.[32]\n\nOn 22 September 1236, the Battle of Saulė between Samogitians and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword took place close to Šiauliai. The Livonian Brothers were smashed during it and their further conquest of the Balts lands were stopped.[33] The battle inspired rebellions among the Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians, Oeselians, tribes previously conquered by the Sword-Brothers. Some thirty years' worth of conquests on the left bank of Daugava were lost.[34] In 2000, the Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments declared 22 September to be the Day of Baltic Unity.","privateMemo":"Polygon62_Lithuania\nリトアニア\n\n","show":true}},{"Position":[[[21.197847258504524,44.717051707349526,0],[21.56204811743079,44.789891879134785,0],[22.280402915037094,44.46336697113192,0],[22.541622841439388,44.789891879134785,0],[22.86814774944225,44.65928191593364,0],[22.672232804640533,44.39806198953135,0],[23.129367675844545,44.20214704472963,0],[23.129367675844545,43.81031715512619,0],[23.717112510249702,44.07153708152848,0],[24.435467307856,43.81031715512619,0],[24.827297197459444,44.00623209992791,0],[25.676261958266892,43.745012173525616,0],[26.655836682275485,44.267452026330204,0],[28.157851259088662,44.267452026330204,0],[28.28846122228981,44.593976934333064,0],[28.027241295887514,44.855196860735354,0],[28.222270304962684,45.33245307989232,0],[28.572010836126836,45.34785202991821,0],[28.60582030102903,45.37635804934555,0],[29.268035946298404,45.18172176873822,0],[29.9144287109375,45.275306701660156,0],[29.782625198364258,45.0744743347168,0],[29.66118621826172,44.93212127685547,0],[29.465246200561523,44.91239547729492,0],[29.293413162231445,44.892704010009766,0],[29.12190055847168,44.78272247314453,0],[28.889911651611328,44.50502395629883,0],[28.776777267456055,44.21479415893555,0],[28.733549118041992,43.860443115234375,0],[28.713769912719727,43.760047912597656,0],[28.684202194213867,43.609256744384766,0],[28.649356842041016,43.49333572387695,0],[28.53175926208496,43.454498291015625,0],[28.390722274780273,43.46709060668945,0],[28.23830223083496,43.40887451171875,0],[28.090984344482422,43.08049774169922,0],[26.851751627077206,42.5695225047153,0],[26.78644664547663,41.851167707109,0],[26.26400679267205,42.11238763351129,0],[24.500772289456577,42.04708265191071,0],[21.692658080631944,42.89604741271816,0],[21.888573025433658,43.745012173525616,0],[21.197847258504524,44.717051707349526,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Bulgar

Novgorodskaya respublika, IPA: [nəvgɐˈrotskəjə rʲɪsˈpublʲɪkə]; Новгородскаѧ землѧ / Novgorodskaję zemlę, Novgorod land; Latin: Novogardie[1]) was a medieval East Slavic state from the 12th to 15th centuries, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the northern Ural Mountains, including the city of Novgorod and the Lake Ladoga regions of modern Russia. Citizens referred to their city-state as \"His Majesty (or Sovereign) Lord Novgorod the Great\" (Gosudař Gospodin Velikij Novgorod), or more often as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" (Gospodin Velikij Novgorod). The Republic prospered as the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League and its Slavic, Baltic and Finnic people were much influenced by the culture of the Viking-Varangians and Byzantine people.\nIn the middle of the 9th century Novgorod was a name used to describe viking staging posts on the trade route from the Baltic Sea to the Byzantine Empire. There's a theory that in fact it was not Novgorod as misinterpreted by later chroniclers (as stated by dendrochronology, Novgorod was founded only in the middle of X century), but Nevo Gardas - viking settlements on Ladoga, as in one of Nestor's chronicles from the 12th century he mentions a lake called \"the Great Nevo\", a clear link to the Neva River and, possibly furthermore, to Finnish nevo \"sea\" or neva \"bog, quagmire\".[3] Chronicles of XII century state that in IX century area of Novgorod (or most probably Nevo Garda, viking settlements on Ladoga) was populated by various Slavic, Finnic and Baltic tribes that were constantly at war with one another for supremacy. However, these tribes came together during the beginning of the 9th century to try and form a negotiated settlement to end military aggression between each other.[4] The Novgorod First Chronicle, a collection of writings depicting the history of Novgorod from 1016-1471, states that these tribes wanted to “Seek a prince who may rule over us and judge us according to law.”[5] By transforming its governing institutions, Novgorod rejected its politically dependent relationship to Kiev.[6]\n\nChronicles state tat in 882, Prince Oleg founded the Kievan Rus', of which Novogorod was a part from then until 1019-1020. Though it is historically unlikely, as Novgorod was founded only in the middle of X century. Novgorod Princes were appointed by the Grand Prince of Kiev (usually one of the elder sons).\n\nThe Novgorod boyars began to dominate the offices of posadnik and tysyatsky, which until about the mid-12th century had been appointed by the grand prince in Kiev. In 1136, the Novgorodians dismissed Prince Vsevolod Mstislavich and over the next century and a half were able to invite in and dismiss a number of princes. However, these invitations or dismissals were often based on who the dominant prince in Rus' or Appanage Russia was at the time, and not on any independent thinking on the part of Novgorod.[7]\n\nCities such as Staraya Russa, Staraya Ladoga, Torzhok, and Oreshek were part of the Novgorodian Land. According to some accounts, a vicar of the archbishop ran the city of Staraya Ladoga in the 13th century. The city of Pskov, initially part of the Novgorodian Land, had de facto independence from at least the 13th century after joining the Hanseatic League. Several princes such as Dovmont (ca 1240-1299) and Vsevolod Mstislavich (before 1117-1138) reigned in Pskov without any deference to or consultation with the prince or other officials in Novgorod. Pskov's independence was acknowledged by the Treaty of Bolotovo in 1348 (see Pskov Republic). Even after this, however, the Archbishop of Novgorod headed the church in Pskov and kept the title \"Archbishop of Novgorod the Great and Pskov\" until 1589. Novgordian Rus' and its inhabitants were much influenced by Vikings culture and people.[8] These cultural and ethnic Scandinavian imprint shaped later the society of Muscovite Rus' and whole Russia.","privateMemo":"Polygon64_Novgorod\nノヴゴロド","show":true}},{"Position":[[[27.631985571183726,47.40059234030129,0],[27.374191479881787,47.98983597756286,0],[24.500772289456577,48.773495756769734,0],[21.974342417306637,49.60867726099148,0],[21.974342417306637,49.759952354555566,0],[21.97172735192973,49.76064970532274,0],[21.953878007034227,50.797950186387496,0],[21.627353099031364,51.5163049839938,0],[21.888573025433654,51.581609965594375,0],[21.953878007034227,52.03874483679839,0],[21.56204811743079,52.29996476320068,0],[21.56204811743079,52.626489671203544,0],[21.56204811743079,53.2142345056087,0],[21.667936016059308,53.83606929248647,0],[22.437918329362333,54.14406221780768,0],[22.80284276784168,52.9530145792064,0],[23.586502547048553,52.365269744801246,0],[26.002786866269755,52.29996476320068,0],[26.329311774272615,52.75709963440468,0],[27.243581516680642,52.9530145792064,0],[27.30888649828121,53.932589303214996,0],[27.89663133268637,54.520334137620154,0],[27.89663133268637,54.977469008824166,0],[27.50480144308293,55.3692988984276,0],[27.574196717309803,55.736315347609846,0],[27.854506030842636,56.29693397467551,0],[27.809566347454105,56.72386096686655,0],[28.026378677859057,56.74244488090126,0],[28.221074104155317,56.583890229423375,0],[28.296236269759294,56.809376726235314,0],[29.016342229232478,56.90046825066491,0],[29.263193003180056,56.554877167138294,0],[30.15185578939134,56.554877167138294,0],[30.892408111234076,55.91306515487459,0],[31.139258885181654,56.406766702769744,0],[30.941778266023594,56.999208560243936,0],[31.484849968708268,57.29542948898103,0],[32.62036352886713,57.29542948898103,0],[32.729199971128764,57.916193180849945,0],[33.708774695137365,57.98149816245052,0],[34.492434474344236,57.850888199249376,0],[36.320973959160284,56.74070351203963,0],[37.9535984991746,57.00192343844193,0],[39.06378318638435,58.37332805205396,0],[38.60664831518034,59.28759779446198,0],[36.45158392236142,60.13656255526942,0],[36.516888903962,60.659002408074016,0],[37.30054868316888,61.1814422608786,0],[38.084208462375756,61.05083229767745,0],[40.04335791039294,60.13656255526942,0],[41.15354259760268,60.20186753687,0],[41.41476252400497,60.463087463272295,0],[41.41476252400497,61.1814422608786,0],[45.92080625444451,62.22632196648777,0],[46.247331162447374,62.095712003286614,0],[46.168472658705234,57.751487668136264,0],[45.79019629124336,57.32844834644479,0],[45.92080625444451,55.303993916827025,0],[45.52897636484107,54.91216402722359,0],[43.831046843226176,54.97746900882416,0],[43.308606990421595,54.71624908242187,0],[43.831046843226176,53.932589303214996,0],[43.831046843226176,52.2346597816001,0],[40.89232267120039,50.99386513118921,0],[38.99847820478377,51.059170112789786,0],[38.47603835197919,50.92856014958864,0],[38.345428388778046,49.62246051757718,0],[37.23524370156831,49.75307048077833,0],[34.88426436394768,48.57758081196801,0],[30.051695725505276,49.295935609574315,0],[29.65986583590184,48.3816658671663,0],[27.631985571183726,47.40059234030129,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Principality of Ryazan","color":"#545faa","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Grand Duchy of Ryazan existed from 1078 when it was separated from the Chernigov Principality as the provincial Murom Principality.\nSometime between 1097 and 1155, the principality became a sovereign state and until 1161, according to the Hypatian Codex, the official name was the Muromo-Ryazan Principality. The first ruler of Ryazan was supposedly Yaroslav Sviatoslavich, Prince of Chernigov (a city of Kievan Rus'), later Prince of Murom-Ryzan. The capital of the Grand Duchy became Ryazan, however the present-day city of Ryazan is located 40 miles north from the original site of the capital today known as Ryazan Staraya (Old Ryazan). By the end of 12th century, the Principality waged wars with the neighboring Grand Duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal. In the course of that stand-off, the city of Ryazan was burned twice in a span of twenty years from 1186 to 1208. In 1217, there was a culminate point in history of Ryazan when during the civil war inside the Duchy six leaders of the state were killed by Gleb Vladimirovich who later defected to Cumans. Sometime around that time the Duchy came under a great influence from the Vladimir-Suzdal which was a factor in the fight of Ryazan to resume its sovereignty. In 1217, Gleb Vladimirovich with the support of Cumans tried to take Ryazan back out of the influence of neighboring northern principality of Vladimir, but he was defeated by another Ryazan prince Ingvar Igorevich who in turn became a sole ruler of the state.\n\nIn December 1237, the Duchy became the first of all other former states of Kievan Rus' to suffer from the Mongol invasion. The Duchy was completely overrun, with almost the whole princely family killed, the capital destroyed, and later moved to another location. In 1238, some of the armed forces of Ryazan withdrew to unite with the Vladimir-Suzdal army and meet with the forces of Batu Khan near Kolomna.","privateMemo":"Polygon65_Riazan\nリャザン公国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[17.751644134521484,42.93709182739258,0],[17.50773802269127,43.093179461612564,0],[17.278751373291016,43.23971939086914,0],[17.195926666259766,43.33968734741211,0],[16.843477249145508,43.406707763671875,0],[16.915184020996094,43.788299560546875,0],[16.905139923095703,43.86363220214844,0],[17.06876477016965,44.26170862454886,0],[17.66120662764384,44.16296831496983,0],[17.957427556380935,44.40981908891741,0],[19.142311271329312,44.40981908891741,0],[19.988745613576953,44.953114189181576,0],[20.494334736936892,44.91662837615561,0],[20.51732071448311,44.91806499975225,0],[20.908998301425065,44.65928191593364,0],[21.197847258504524,44.717051707349526,0],[21.888573025433658,43.745012173525616,0],[21.692658080631944,42.89604741271816,0],[20.908998301425065,42.83074243111759,0],[19.81062889099121,41.77851104736328,0],[19.661550521850586,41.81505584716797,0],[19.57137680053711,41.86334228515625,0],[19.542129516601562,41.87899398803711,0],[19.34670066833496,41.94906234741211,0],[19.339208602905273,42.01651382446289,0],[19.113563537597656,42.234764099121094,0],[18.73230743408203,42.36971664428711,0],[18.717252731323242,42.379112243652344,0],[18.452375411987305,42.544410705566406,0],[18.205032348632812,42.711429595947266,0],[17.85004425048828,42.88157272338867,0],[17.79934310913086,42.9058723449707,0],[17.751644134521484,42.93709182739258,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Serbia","color":"#c17c5c","image":"220px-Detail_of_Krunisanje_Cara_Dušana_by_Paja_Jovanović.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Serbs, a Slavic tribe that settled in the Balkans in the 6th or early 7th century, established the Serbian Principality by the 8th century.

Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to a kingdom (and briefly an empire) and Serbian bishopric to an autocephalous archbishopric (through the effort of Sava, the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many monasteries (several being World Heritage sites) and fortifications. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, Vojvodina, was ruled by the Kingdom of Hungary. The period known as the Fall of the Serbian Empire saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the Battle of Kosovo (1389) against the rising Ottoman Empire. The Serbian Despotate was finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw large migrations of Serbs to the west and north.","privateMemo":"Polygon66_Serbia","show":true}},{"Position":[[[13.571359634399414,45.71146011352539,0],[13.35982894897461,45.74349594116211,0],[13.308272361755371,45.59935760498047,0],[13.102313995361328,45.57534408569336,0],[12.651819229125977,45.411258697509766,0],[12.68687629699707,45.479286193847656,0],[12.483407020568848,45.41926193237305,0],[12.45508098602295,45.307254791259766,0],[12.384035110473633,45.28725051879883,0],[12.379853248596191,45.23126220703125,0],[12.174337966809038,45.45321362453809,0],[12.348484584410567,45.779738532540954,0],[12.84915611001496,45.93211682294229,0],[13.28452265401878,45.99742180454286,0],[13.571359634399414,45.71146011352539,0]],[[14.37827205657959,45.02735900878906,0],[14.392176628112793,44.95951843261719,0],[14.264063835144043,44.91167449951172,0],[14.194920539855957,44.800071716308594,0],[14.098766326904297,44.776153564453125,0],[13.875722885131836,45.06732940673828,0],[13.84725284576416,45.19606018066406,0],[13.730554580688477,45.471282958984375,0],[13.759940147399902,45.4765739440918,0],[13.952749252319336,45.51130294799805,0],[14.003647804260254,45.583343505859375,0],[14.1987923964268,45.47498195173828,0],[14.15525574202642,45.4096769701377,0],[14.002877451625082,45.32260366133694,0],[14.111719087626037,44.996078753334075,0],[14.37827205657959,45.02735900878906,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Venice","color":"#aae8d4","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"From the 9th to the 12th century, Venice developed into a city state (an Italian thalassocracy or Repubblica Marinara: the other three of these were Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi). Its strategic position at the head of the Adriatic made Venetian naval and commercial power almost invulnerable.[citation needed] With the elimination of pirates along the Dalmatian coast, the city became a flourishing trade center between Western Europe and the rest of the world (especially the Byzantine Empire and Asia) with a naval power protecting sea routes from piracy.[27]\n\nThe Republic of Venice seized a number of places on the eastern shores of the Adriatic before 1200, mostly for commercial reasons, because pirates based there were a menace to trade. The Doge already carried the titles of Duke of Dalmatia and Duke of Istria. Later mainland possessions, which extended across Lake Garda as far west as the Adda River, were known as the \"Terraferma\", and were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee Alpine trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat, on which the city depended. In building its maritime commercial empire, the Republic dominated the trade in salt,[28] acquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean, including Crete, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, and became a major power-broker in the Near East. By the standards of the time, Venice's stewardship of its mainland territories was relatively enlightened and the citizens of such towns as Bergamo, Brescia and Verona rallied to the defence of Venetian sovereignty when it was threatened by invaders.\n\nVenice remained closely associated with Constantinople, being twice granted trading privileges in the Eastern Roman Empire, through the so-called Golden Bulls or \"chrysobulls\" in return for aiding the Eastern Empire to resist Norman and Turkish incursions. In the first chrysobull, Venice acknowledged its homage to the Empire; but not in the second, reflecting the decline of Byzantium and the rise of Venice's power.[29][30]\n\nVenice became an imperial power following the Fourth Crusade, which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking Constantinople and establishing the Latin Empire. As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to Venice. This plunder included the gilt bronze horses from the Hippodrome of Constantinople, which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of Venice, St Mark's Basilica, although the originals have been replaced with replicas and are now stored within the basilica. After the fall of Constantinople, the former Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians. Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the Duchy of the Archipelago, and captured Crete.","privateMemo":"Polygon67_Venice","show":true}},{"Position":[[[9.635825157165527,42.81110763549805,0],[9.609158515930176,42.59756851196289,0],[9.662216186523438,42.573028564453125,0],[9.690375328063965,42.4233512878418,0],[9.656172752380371,42.065277099609375,0],[9.56112003326416,41.918182373046875,0],[9.50820255279541,41.59223937988281,0],[9.376688003540039,41.366878509521484,0],[9.242603302001953,41.386470794677734,0],[9.21693229675293,41.47465133666992,0],[9.032416343688965,41.508949279785156,0],[8.930584907531738,41.57754135131836,0],[9.05831241607666,41.670650482177734,0],[9.026918411254883,41.70494842529297,0],[8.83059024810791,41.749061584472656,0],[8.946113586425781,41.8985710144043,0],[8.896492958068848,41.93043518066406,0],[8.76552963256836,41.8985710144043,0],[8.741596221923828,41.964752197265625,0],[8.793251991271973,41.97456359863281,0],[8.871975898742676,42.045658111572266,0],[8.830118179321289,42.114315032958984,0],[8.714362144470215,42.15109634399414,0],[8.72091007232666,42.224674224853516,0],[8.832085609436035,42.278629302978516,0],[8.704110145568848,42.37675094604492,0],[8.81296443939209,42.50431823730469,0],[9.082666397094727,42.64173889160156,0],[9.204056739807129,42.65156173706055,0],[9.222091674804688,42.708011627197266,0],[9.353124618530273,42.72764205932617,0],[9.441356658935547,42.68101119995117,0],[9.484055519104004,42.74482727050781,0],[9.474184036254883,42.89948272705078,0],[9.506853103637695,43.00016403198242,0],[9.570714950561523,43.00507354736328,0],[9.617902755737305,42.92649841308594,0],[9.635825157165527,42.81110763549805,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Corsica","color":"#efa6dc","image":"220px-Genoise_tower_in_corsica.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The crushing defeat experienced by Pisa in 1284 in the Battle of Meloria against Genoa had among its consequences the end of the Pisan rule and the beginning of the Genoese influence in Corsica:[4] this was contested initially by the King of Aragon, who in 1296 had received from the Pope the investiture over Sardinia and Corsica.[5] A popular revolution against this and the feudal lords, led by Sambucuccio d'Alando, got the aid of Genoa.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior deacons, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.[6]\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor Constantine I, who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restoring to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).[5] The Lateran Palace was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.[5]\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of Odoacer and, later, the Ostrogoths, the Church organization in Italy, with the pope at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole Church.[citation needed]\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the Byzantine Empire, under emperor Justinian I, launched a reconquest of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the Lombards entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from Ravenna, where the Emperor's representative, or Exarch, was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"[7][8][9]), plus coastal enclaves.[10]\n\nWith effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.[citation needed] While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the Duchy of Rome, an area roughly equivalent to modern-day Latium, became an independent state ruled by the pope.[11]\n\nThe Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; Pope Gregory II even excommunicated Emperor Leo III during the Iconoclastic Controversy.[citation needed] Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through diplomacy.[citation needed] In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard aggrandizement on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the Lombard king Liutprand's Donation of Sutri (728) to Pope Gregory II.\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of Avignon, surrounded by Provence and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the \"Avignonese\" or \"Babylonian Captivity\".[16][17][18][19][20][21] During this period the city of Avignon itself was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the French Revolution.\n\nDuring this Avignon Papacy, local despots took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the Pepoli in Bologna, the Ordelaffi in Forlì, the Manfredi in Faenza, the Malatesta in Rimini all gave nominal acknowledgement to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.\n\nIn Ferrara, the death of Azzo VIII d'Este without legitimate heirs (1308[22]) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, Robert d'Anjou, King of Naples, for only nine years before the citizens recalled the Este from exile (1317); interdiction and excommunications were in vain: in 1332 John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.[23]\n\nIn Rome itself the Orsini and the Colonna struggled for supremacy,[24] dividing the city's rioni between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of Cola di Rienzo, who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,[25] and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.[26] To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.[26] As Prof. Guido Ruggiero states, \"even with the support of Petrarch, his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"[26]\n\nThe Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of Cardinal Albornoz, who was appointed papal legate, and his condottieri heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and Giovanni Visconti, he defeated Giovanni di Vico, lord of Viterbo, moving against Galeotto Malatesta of Rimini and the Ordelaffi of Forlì, the Montefeltro of Urbino and the da Polenta of Ravenna, and against the cities of Senigallia and Ancona. The last holdouts against full papal control were Giovanni Manfredi of Faenza and Francesco II Ordelaffi of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ, which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These Constitutiones Egidiane mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. Pope Urban V ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.[27]","privateMemo":"Polygon69_PapalStates\n教皇領","show":true}},{"Position":[[[14.280065781875074,42.650748378392095,0],[14.296433448791504,42.62649917602539,0],[14.608596801757812,42.37008285522461,0],[14.722972869873047,42.246673583984375,0],[14.923619270324707,42.15873336791992,0],[14.942191123962402,42.06412887573242,0],[15.126069068908691,41.98874282836914,0],[15.65226936340332,41.87369918823242,0],[16.216506958007812,41.921295166015625,0],[16.391075134277344,41.85783386230469,0],[16.40207862854004,41.76264190673828,0],[16.19281005859375,41.65161895751953,0],[16.07691764831543,41.51911544799805,0],[16.1947078704834,41.42311477661133,0],[16.623931884765625,41.29569625854492,0],[17.149627685546875,41.11078643798828,0],[17.52293586730957,40.946224212646484,0],[18.23758316040039,40.613624572753906,0],[18.26360511779785,40.5305061340332,0],[18.587276458740234,40.32472229003906,0],[18.7263126373291,40.11110305786133,0],[18.63734245300293,39.91537857055664,0],[18.56858253479004,39.763694763183594,0],[18.363794326782227,39.890106201171875,0],[18.220731735229492,39.964866638183594,0],[18.171409606933594,40.18386459350586,0],[18.053268432617188,40.260467529296875,0],[17.822813034057617,40.3048095703125,0],[17.605314254760742,40.30889892578125,0],[17.407835006713867,40.414913177490234,0],[17.44646644592285,40.512733459472656,0],[17.287744522094727,40.542083740234375,0],[17.152376174926758,40.49806213378906,0],[17.047794342041016,40.38010787963867,0],[16.931228637695312,40.20057678222656,0],[16.808076858520508,40.10688018798828,0],[16.827516555786133,39.98472595214844,0],[16.738670349121094,39.84853744506836,0],[16.73576545715332,39.71448516845703,0],[17.07765007019043,39.56062316894531,0],[17.352733612060547,39.43877410888672,0],[17.31108283996582,39.29744338989258,0],[17.324661254882812,39.10299301147461,0],[17.384376525878906,39.039180755615234,0],[17.29835319519043,38.9319953918457,0],[17.00136375427246,38.94282913208008,0],[16.816993713378906,38.84429931640625,0],[16.725866317749023,38.74199676513672,0],[16.775665283203125,38.474090576171875,0],[16.53435707092285,38.33771514892578,0],[16.256607055664062,37.94814682006836,0],[15.988901138305664,37.92667770385742,0],[15.913890838623047,37.95840835571289,0],[15.83113956451416,38.021183013916016,0],[15.830241203308105,38.25005340576172,0],[15.994532585144043,38.31336975097656,0],[16.137130737304688,38.556888580322266,0],[16.030963897705078,38.639705657958984,0],[16.193510055541992,38.75173568725586,0],[16.355873107910156,38.718238830566406,0],[16.415889739990234,38.794925689697266,0],[16.38087272644043,38.94796371459961,0],[16.286226272583008,39.02944564819336,0],[16.19321632385254,39.4453239440918,0],[16.028335571289062,39.6776008605957,0],[15.960685729980469,39.950599670410156,0],[15.869864463806152,40.10883331298828,0],[15.719588279724121,40.08292007446289,0],[15.635697364807129,40.005943298339844,0],[15.230927467346191,40.22916793823242,0],[15.102334976196289,40.25843048095703,0],[15.19598388671875,40.389190673828125,0],[15.154668807983398,40.568450927734375,0],[14.946981430053711,40.72178649902344,0],[14.53779125213623,40.61057662963867,0],[14.553433418273926,40.65949630737305,0],[14.698254585266113,40.74693298339844,0],[14.573974609375,40.86844253540039,0],[14.443659782409668,40.86991500854492,0],[14.254537582397461,40.78448486328125,0],[14.14554214477539,41.01500701904297,0],[14.056164741516113,41.10792922973633,0],[14.000670433044434,41.210418701171875,0],[13.964171029170481,41.22367039932788,0],[14.016852185120914,41.33527585064923,0],[14.182894202174591,41.3518800523546,0],[14.199498403879957,41.368484254059965,0],[14.232706807290693,41.41829685917607,0],[14.166290000469221,41.48471366599754,0],[14.166290000469221,41.53452627111364,0],[14.133081597058489,41.650755683051216,0],[14.083268991942386,41.650755683051216,0],[14.083268991942386,41.68396408646195,0],[14.133081597058489,41.76698509498878,0],[14.066664790237017,41.80019349839952,0],[14.066664790237017,41.76698509498878,0],[13.850810168067241,41.816797700104885,0],[13.850810168067241,41.76698509498878,0],[13.800997562951139,41.816797700104885,0],[13.767789159540403,41.88321450692636,0],[13.834205966361873,41.94963131374783,0],[13.834205966361873,42.032652322274664,0],[13.784393361245769,42.065860725685404,0],[13.784393361245769,42.115673330801506,0],[13.618351344192096,42.21529854103371,0],[13.668163949308198,42.24850694444444,0],[13.618351344192096,42.38134055808738,0],[13.751184957835035,42.44775736490885,0],[13.834205966361873,42.54738257514106,0],[13.91722697488871,42.41454896149812,0],[13.967039580004812,42.48096576831959,0],[14.033456386826284,42.497569970024955,0],[14.033456386826284,42.5805909785518,0],[14.133081597058489,42.54738257514106,0],[14.199498403879957,42.6304035836679,0],[14.280065781875074,42.650748378392095,0]],[[15.146061897277832,36.75553512573242,0],[14.82568645477295,36.793113708496094,0],[14.419576644897461,37.0662956237793,0],[14.072068214416504,37.17392349243164,0],

died in 1101. His wife Adelaide ruled until 1112, when their son Roger II of Sicily came of age.[47] Having succeeded his brother Simon as Count of Sicily, Roger II was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings, which included the Maltese Islands and the Duchies of Apulia and Calabria.[48][51]\n\nRoger II appointed the powerful Greek George of Antioch to be his \"emir of emirs\" and continued the syncretism of his father. During this period, the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe—even wealthier than the Kingdom of England.[52]\n\nThe court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence.[53][54] The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings that the world has ever seen.[53]\n\nSignificantly, immigrants from Northern Italy and Campania arrived during this period. Linguistically, the island shifted from being one third Greek- and two-thirds Arabic-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest to becoming fully Latinised.[54] In terms of the church, it became completely Roman Catholic; previously, it had been Eastern Orthodox under the Byzantines.\nAfter a century, the Norman Hauteville dynasty died out; the last direct descendant and heir of Roger, Constance, married Emperor Henry VI.[56] This eventually led to the crown of Sicily being passed on to the Hohenstaufen Dynasty, who were Germans from Swabia. The last of the Hohenstaufens, Frederick II, the only son of Constance, was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the Middle Ages. His mother's will had asked Pope Innocent III to undertake the guardianship of her son. The pope gladly accepted the role, as it allowed him to detach Sicily from the rest of The Holy Roman Empire, thus ending the spectre of the Papal States being surrounded. Frederick was four when, at Palermo, he was crowned King of Sicily in 1198. Frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of Palermo. There he picked up the many languages he heard spoken, such as Arabic and Greek, and learned some of the lore of the Jewish community. At age twelve, he dismissed Innocent's deputy regent and took over the government; at fifteen he married Constance of Aragon, and began his reclamation of the imperial crown.

His Golden Bull of 1222 was the first constitution in Continental Europe. The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament (parlamentum publicum).\n\nIn 1241–1242, the kingdom received a major blow with the Mongol (Tatar) invasion. Up to half of Hungary's then population of 2,000,000 were victims of the invasion.[72] King Béla IV let Cumans and Jassic people into the country, who were fleeing the Mongols.[73] Over the centuries, they were fully assimilated into the Hungarian population.[74]\n\nAs a consequence, after the Mongols retreated, King Béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications, to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion. The Mongols returned to Hungary in 1285, but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics (using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights) stopped them. The invading Mongol force was defeated[75] near Pest by the royal army of Ladislaus IV of Hungary. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force.\nThe Kingdom of Hungary reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of interregnum (1301–1308), the first Angevin king, Charles I of Hungary – a bilineal descendant of the Árpád dynasty – successfully restored royal power, and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called \"little kings\". The second Angevin Hungarian king, Louis the Great (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also King of Poland from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when Sigismund of Luxembourg (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became Holy Roman Emperor.

Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.[43] His descendants—the Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II Augustus. The French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades in order to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France.[44] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. \"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states.[44] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[45] Later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the north, centre and west of France. Meanwhile, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\n\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[46] Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[46] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[46] Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death,[47] England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.[48] The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.","privateMemo":"Polygon72_France","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0],[-2.557832956314087,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.711667776107788,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.7661285400390625,36.758121490478516,0],[-4.242921829223633,36.738990783691406,0],[-4.553639888763428,36.50307846069336,0],[-5.013072490692139,36.42656707763672,0],[-5.170563697814941,36.25444793701172,0],[-5.183085918426514,36.126956939697266,0],[-5.2205963134765625,36.088714599609375,0],[-5.253427028656006,36.184329986572266,0],[-5.284269332885742,36.190696716308594,0],[-5.281822681427002,36.082340240478516,0],[-5.456923484802246,36.02497863769531,0],[-5.646350383758545,36.088714599609375,0],[-6.000797271728516,36.299068450927734,0],[-6.1013078689575195,36.471195220947266,0],[-6.085216999053955,36.589149475097656,0],[-6.240361213684082,36.64015579223633,0],[-6.2968220710754395,36.735801696777344,0],[-6.2180495262146,36.80913543701172,0],[-6.428490161895752,37.03872299194336,0],[-4.997052575727812,37.54992189755857,0],[-3.760702234302377,37.47265000121948,0],[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Emirate of Granada","color":"#3566bf","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Emirate of Granada (Arabic: إمارة غرﻧﺎﻃﺔ‎, trans. Imārat Ġarnāṭah), also known as the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada (Spanish: Reino Nazarí de Granada), was an emirate established in 1230 by Muhammad ibn al-Ahmar.[1] After Prince Idris left Iberia to take the Almohad Caliphate leadership, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar established the last Muslim dynasty on the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids. The Nasrid emirs were responsible for building the Alhambra palace complex as it is known today. By 1250, the Emirate was the last part of the Iberian peninsula held by the Muslims. It roughly corresponded to the modern Spanish provinces of Granada, Almería, and Málaga. Andalusian Arabic was the mother tongue of the majority of the population. For two more centuries, the region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic prosperity.\n\nIt was gradually conquered by the Crown of Castile and dissolved with the 1491 Treaty of Granada, ending the Granada War.

Sultanate","color":"#efd28f","image":"170px-A_Mamluk_from_Aleppo.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Mamluk Sultanate (Arabic: سلطنة المماليك‎ Salṭanat al-Mamālīk) was a medieval realm spanning Egypt, the Levant, and Hejaz. It lasted from the overthrow of the Ayyubid dynasty until the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517. Historians have traditionally broken the era of Mamlūk rule into two periods—one covering 1250–1382, the other, 1382–1517. Western historians call the former the \"Baḥrī\" period and the latter the \"Burjī\" due to the political dominance of the regimes known by these names during the respective eras. Contemporary Muslim historians refer to the same divisions as the \"Turkic\"[3][4][5][6][7] and \"Circassian\" periods in order to stress the change in the ethnic origins of the majority of Mamlūks.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\nThe Mamlūk state reached its height under Turkic rule with Arabic culture and then fell into a prolonged phase of decline under the Circassians.[3][8] The sultanate's ruling caste was composed of Mamluks, soldiers of predominantly Cuman-Kipchaks (from Crimea),[9] Circassian, Abkhazian,[10] Oghuz Turks[11] and Georgian slave origin.[12][13] While Mamluks were purchased, their status was above ordinary slaves, who were not allowed to carry weapons or perform certain tasks. Mamluks were considered to be \"true lords\", with social status above citizens of Egypt. Though it declined towards the end of its existence, at its height the sultanate represented the zenith of medieval Egyptian and Levantine political, economic, and cultural glory in the Islamic Golden

Caliphate","color":"#b1a557","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Hafsids (Arabic: الحفصيون‎ al-Ḥafṣiyūn) were a Tunisian Sunni Muslim dynasty of Berber descent[1] who ruled Ifriqiya (western Libya, Tunisia, and eastern Algeria) from 1229 to 1574.\nThe dynasty was named after Muhammad bin Abu Hafs[2] leader from the Masmuda tribe of Morocco. He was appointed governor of Ifriqiya (present day Tunisia) by Muhammad an-Nasir, Caliph of the Almohad empire between 1198-1213. The Banu Hafs, were a powerful group amongst the Almohads; their ancestor is Omar Abu Hafs al-Hentati, a member of the council of ten and a close companion of Ibn Tumart. His original name was \"Fesga Oumzal\", which later changed to \"Abu Hafs Omar ibn Yahya al-Hentati\" (also known as \"Omar Inti\") since it was a tradition of Ibn Tumart to rename his close companions once they had adhered to his religious teachings.[3]\n\nThe Hafsids as governors on behalf of the Almohads faced constant threats from Banu Ghaniya who were descendants of Almoravid princes which the Almohads had defeated and replaced as a ruling dynasty.\nThe Hafsids were Ifriqiya governors of the Almohads until 1229, when they declared independence. After the split of the Hafsids from the Almohads under Abu Zakariya (1229–1249), Abu Zakariya organised the administration in Ifriqiya (the Roman province of Africa in modern Maghreb; today's Tunisia, eastern Algeria and western Libya) and built Tunis up as the economic and cultural centre of the empire. At the same time, many Muslims from Al-Andalus fleeing the Spanish Reconquista of Castile and Aragon were absorbed. He also conquered the Kingdom of Tlemcen in 1242 and made the Abdalwadids his vassals. His successor Muhammad I al-Mustansir (1249–1277) took the title of Caliph.\n\nHe extended the boundaries of his State by subjugating the central Maghreb, going so far as to impose his overlordship over the Kingdom of Tlemcen, northern Morocco and the Nasrids of Granada Spain. The Hafsids become completely independent in 1264. The successor of Abû Zakariya' Yahya, Abu ' Abd Allah Muhammad al-Mustansir, proclaimed himself Caliph in 1256 and continued the policies of his father.

Empire","color":"#ff0000","image":"250px-Meister_von_Nerezi_001.jpg","religion":"","memo":"John and Manuel pursued active military policies, and both deployed considerable resources on sieges and on city defences; aggressive fortification policies were at the heart of their imperial military policies.[141] Despite the defeat at Myriokephalon, the policies of Alexios, John and Manuel resulted in vast territorial gains, increased frontier stability in Asia Minor, and secured the stabilisation of the Empire's European frontiers. From c. 1081 to c. 1180, the Komnenian army assured the Empire's security, enabling Byzantine civilisation to flourish.[142]\n\nThis allowed the Western provinces to achieve an economic revival that continued until the close of the century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century, population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the Genoese and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with the Empire via Constantinople.[143]\n\nIn artistic terms, there was a revival in mosaic, and regional schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.[144] During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression.[145] In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by a significant increase in the publication of commentaries on classical works.[123] In addition, the first transmission of classical Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.\nManuel's death on 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son Alexios II Komnenos on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent in the office, and with his mother Maria of Antioch's Frankish background, made his regency unpopular.[146] Eventually, Andronikos I Komnenos, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent coup d'état.[147] Utilizing his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, he marched on to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a massacre of the Latins.[147] After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II, and took his 12-year-old wife Agnes of France for himself.[147]\n\nAndronikos began his reign well; in particular, the measures he took to reform the government of the Empire have been praised by historians. According to George Ostrogorsky, Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces, Andronikos's reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.[148] The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.[149] Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the Emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.[148]\n\nDespite his military background, Andronikos failed to deal with Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185.[150] Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, but other than that he was indifferent to the populace. He was finally overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.[151]\n\nThe reign of Isaac II, and more so that of his brother Alexios III, saw the collapse of what remained of the centralised machinery of Byzantine government and defence. Although the Normans were driven out of Greece, in 1186 the Vlachs and Bulgars began a rebellion that led to the formation of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The internal policy of the Angeloi was characterised by the squandering of the public treasure and fiscal maladministration. Imperial authority was severely weakened, and the growing power vacuum at the center of the Empire encouraged fragmentation. There is evidence that some Komnenian heirs had set up a semi-independent state in Trebizond before 1204.[152] According to Alexander Vasiliev, \"the dynasty of the Angeloi, Greek in its origin, ... accelerated the ruin of the Empire, already weakened without and disunited within.\n","privateMemo":"Polygon77_ByzantineEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[37.45648956298828,41.04469299316406,0],[38.02550506591797,41.02660369873047,0],[38.51762771606445,40.93787384033203,0],[38.8548469543457,40.938541412353516,0],[39.342308044433594,41.0612907409668,0],[39.5738410949707,41.080970764160156,0],[39.866668701171875,41.0174674987793,0],[40.21037673950195,40.97330093383789,0],[40.56467819213867,40.98041534423828,0],[40.81355667114258,41.04499816894531,0],[41.49678039550781,41.30279541015625,0],[41.687625885009766,41.453514099121094,0],[40.96541928346953,40.58573973601814,0],[40.40809553739787,40.37674333124127,0],[39.014786172218734,40.1677469264644,0],[37.96980414833439,40.30707786298232,0],[37.45648956298828,41.04469299316406,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Trebizond","color":"#ec7170","image":"260px-Trabzon,_Hagia_Sophia_Ἁγία_Σοφία_(39484827385).jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy and successor state of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia,[5] commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezundines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the “princes of the Lazes”, while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica,[6] in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes.[7] Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Lascaris and later with the Palaiologos, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.[8][9]\n\nAfter the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade overthrew Alexios V and established the Latin Empire, the Empire of Trebizond became one of three Byzantine successor states to claim the imperial throne, alongside the Empire of Nicaea under the Laskaris family and the Despotate of Epirus under a branch of the Angelos family.[10] The ensuing wars would see the Empire of Thessalonica, the imperial government that sprung from Epirus, collapse following conflicts with Nicaea and Bulgaria and the final recapture of Constantinople by the Empire of Nicaea in 1261. Despite the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople, the Emperors of Trebizond would continue to style themselves as \"Roman Emperors\" for decades and continued to press their claim on the Imperial throne. Emperor John II of Trebizond officially gave up the Trapezuntine claim to the Roman imperial title and Constantinople itself 11 years after the Nicaeans recaptured the city, altering his imperial title from \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" to \"Emperor and Autocrat of all the East, Iberia (i.e. Lazica) and Perateia\".[11]\n\nThe Trapezuntine monarchy would survive the longest among the Byzantine successor states. The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire c. 1340, thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond would last until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity,[12] marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously. The Crimean Principality of Theodoro, an offshoot of Trebizond, lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in 1475.","privateMemo":"Polygon78_Trebizond\nトレビゾンド帝国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[36.094539642333984,36.7880859375,0],[35.875404357910156,36.62275695800781,0],[35.771278381347656,36.60438919067383,0],[35.709835052490234,36.57552719116211,0],[35.75126647949219,36.55715560913086,0],[35.6982536315918,36.4600715637207,0],[35.62074661254883,36.44957733154297,0],[35.59236145019531,36.47056579589844,0],[35.55784225463867,36.431209564208984,0],[35.424190521240234,36.40497589111328,0],[35.2750358581543,36.50468063354492,0],[35.07357406616211,36.593894958496094,0],[34.86604690551758,36.66474533081055,0],[34.68879318237305,36.64375305175781,0],[34.306884765625,36.39729690551758,0],[34.15537643432617,36.268550872802734,0],[34.157718658447266,36.17673110961914,0],[34.09464645385742,36.15574645996094,0],[34.0395393371582,36.124267578125,0],[34.03736114501953,36.08754348754883,0],[33.95684051513672,36.163612365722656,0],[33.68536376953125,36.07125473022461,0],[33.375,35.98785400390625,0],[33.10778045654297,35.99366760253906,0],[32.8440055847168,36.02497100830078,0],[32.53864288330078,36.14533996582031,0],[32.10567092895508,36.51383590698242,0],[31.57435417175293,36.72931671142578,0],[31.10897445678711,36.811187744140625,0],[30.79725456237793,36.77870559692383,0],[30.743730545043945,36.66393280029297,0],[30.700315475463867,36.38995361328125,0],[30.676496505737305,36.20522689819336,0],[30.598526000976562,36.13501739501953,0],[30.483556747436523,36.1347770690918,0],[30.369794845581055,36.20458984375,0],[29.865619659423828,36.09531784057617,0],[29.675596237182617,36.107666015625,0],[29.50185203552246,36.19009017944336,0],[29.205915451049805,36.711769104003906,0],[30.794260917661855,37.79912100565988,0],[30.933591854179767,39.680088648651704,0],[32.18757028284099,39.680088648651704,0],[34.69552714016342,40.93406707731293,0],[34.866573333740234,41.892555236816406,0],[35.20553207397461,42.06013488769531,0],[35.302494049072266,41.82283401489258,0],[35.48973846435547,41.68844985961914,0],[35.6151008605957,41.6437873840332,0],[35.88151931762695,41.63790512084961,0],[36.16145706176758,41.70261764526367,0],[36.36503219604492,41.36947250366211,0],[36.5865592956543,41.25448989868164,0],[36.84490966796875,41.33195495605469,0],[37.02067565917969,41.30665588378906,0],[37.45648956298828,41.04469299316406,0],[37.96980414833439,40.30707786298232,0],[39.014786172218734,40.1677469264644,0],[40.40809553739787,40.37674333124127,0],[40.96541928346953,40.58573973601814,0],[41.687625885009766,41.453514099121094,0],[41.41541635176711,40.26076162061818,0],[39.351585333089815,38.63918010594318,0],[38.81335234052175,38.38501452611937,0],[36.69808830907618,37.38613984460339,0],[36.992921311744354,37.01759859126817,0],[36.094539642333984,36.7880859375,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Seljuk Caliphate","color":"#88a1fa","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Seljuk Empire (Persian: آل سلجوق‎, translit. Āl-e Saljuq, lit. 'House of Saljuq') or Great Seljuq Empire[13][a] was a medieval Turko-Persian[16] Sunni Muslim empire, originating from the Qiniq branch of Oghuz Turks.[17] The Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush to western Anatolia and the Levant, and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf. The Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg (1016–1063) in 1037. From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia, before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire, which became one of the reasons for the first crusade (1095-1099). From c. 1150-1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was around 1260 invaded by the Mongols. The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates. Eventually one of these, the Ottoman, would conquer the rest.\n\nSeljuk gave his name to both the Seljuk empire and the Seljuk dynasty. The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern Islamic world and played a key role in the first and second crusades. Highly Persianized[18] in culture[19] and language,[20] the Seljuks also played an important role in the development of the Turko-Persian tradition,[21] even exporting Persian culture to Anatolia.[22][23] The settlement of Turkic tribes in the northwestern peripheral parts of the empire, for the strategic military purpose of fending off invasions from neighboring states, led to the

the Mongol House of Hulagu. It was founded in the 13th century and was based primarily in Iran as well as neighboring territories, such as present-day Azerbaijan and the central and eastern parts of present-day Turkey.

With the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire after 1259 it became a functionally separate khanate. At its greatest extent, the state expanded into territories that today comprise most of Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Turkey, western Afghanistan, and the Northwestern edge of the Indian sub-continent.

This period during the reigns of David IV (r.1089–1125) and his granddaughter Tamar (r.1184–1213) has been widely termed as Georgia's Golden Age or the Georgian Renaissance.[41] This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its Western European analogue, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.[42] The Golden age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\", the latter which is considered a national epic.[43][44]\n\nDavid suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle of Didgori and liberated Tbilisi.[45]\n\nThe 29-year reign of Tamar, the first female ruler of Georgia, is considered the most successful in Georgian history.[46] Tamar was given the title \"king of kings\" (mepe mepeta).[40] She succeeded in neutralizing opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the downfall of the rival powers of the Seljuks and Byzantium. Supported by a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the Caucasus, and extended over large parts of present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, and eastern Turkey as well as parts of northern Iran,[47] until its collapse under the Mongol attacks within two decades after Tamar's death in 1213.[48]\n\nThe revival of the Kingdom of Georgia was set back after Tbilisi was captured and destroyed by the Khwarezmian leader Jalal ad-Din in 1226.[49] The Mongols were expelled by George V of Georgia (r.1299–1302), son of Demetrius II of Georgia (r.1270–1289), who was named \"Brilliant\" for his role in restoring the country's previous strength and Christian culture. George V was the last great king of the unified Georgian state. After his death, different local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the Kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by several disastrous invasions by Tamerlane.

Empire","color":"#cab58e","image":"220px-Talang_Tuo_Inscription.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Srivijaya (also written Sri Vijaya or Sriwijaya in Indonesian or Malay),[1]:131 was a dominant thalassocratic Indonesian city-state based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, which influenced much of Southeast Asia.[2] Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 8th to the 12th century. Srivijaya was the first unified kingdom to dominate much of Indonesian archipelago.[3] The rise of the Srivijayan Empire is seen to run parallel to the end of the Malay sea-faring period. Due to its location, this once powerful state developed complex technology utilizing maritime resources. In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, thus transforming it into a prestige goods based economy.[4]\n\nThe earliest reference to it dates from the 7th century. A Tang Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 for six months.[5][6] The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, dated 16 June 682.[7] Between the late 7th and early 11th century, Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring Java, Kambuja and Champa. Srivijaya's main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East.\n\nThe kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the rival Javanese Singhasari and Majapahit empires.[2] After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. It was not until 1918 that French historian George Cœdès, of École française d'Extrême-Orient, formally postulated its existence.","privateMemo":"Polygon84_SrivijayaEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[116.1595687866211,-3.1823513507843018,0],[116.06703186035156,-3.3604931831359863,0],[116.00997161865234,-3.519497871398926,0],[115.77180480957031,-3.786937952041626,0],[115.1894760131836,-4.061484336853027,0],[114.91607666015625,-4.189181327819824,0],[114.78453826904297,-4.278438091278076,0],[114.6972885131836,-4.138813018798828,0],[114.70829010009766,-3.9481313228607178,0],[114.5599136352539,-3.5861876010894775,0],[114.42213439941406,-3.4149038791656494,0],[114.30316162109375,-3.332540512084961,0],[114.17426300048828,-3.3455286026000977,0],[113.9481201171875,-3.5811667442321777,0],[113.81205749511719,-3.594162702560425,0],[113.66442108154297,-3.3656997680664062,0],[113.52367401123047,-3.2770347595214844,0],[113.32716369628906,-3.226618528366089,0],[113.1529769897461,-3.0236237049102783,0],[112.9990463256836,-2.9540488719940186,0],[112.84202575683594,-3.3166401386260986,0],[112.7813949584961,-3.405745267868042,0],[112.60991668701172,-3.4315297603607178,0],[112.44928741455078,-3.3810369968414307,0],[112.25052642822266,-3.438664436340332,0],[112.10704040527344,-3.597860813140869,0],[111.943115234375,-3.6299872398376465,0],[111.9169692993164,-3.3821940422058105,0],[111.93225860595703,-3.2423477172851562,0],[111.79087829589844,-2.7787234783172607,0],[111.63965606689453,-2.957002639770508,0],[111.00048828125,-3.1553919315338135,0],[110.85617065429688,-2.971403121948242,0],[110.5687255859375,-2.9783856868743896,0],[110.44209289550781,-3.04856014251709,0],[110.30596923828125,-3.0615689754486084,0],[111.53653862979262,-1.3528721558737615,0],[113.00477686989313,-1.8579202514111408,0],[113.97548711502199,-1.8579202514111408,0],[114.83834066624763,-1.642206863604729,0],[116.1595687866211,-3.1823513507843018,0]],[[109.42067855728796,-6.9974124069131545,0],[109.58565521240234,-6.971676826477051,0],[110.23094177246094,-7.02747917175293,0],[110.44623565673828,-7.014311790466309,0],[110.59955596923828,-6.9377055168151855,0],[110.69519805908203,-6.6451497077941895,0],[110.81695556640625,-6.524126052856445,0],[111.01824951171875,-6.517334461212158,0],[111.11817932128906,-6.612457752227783,0],[111.24838256835938,-6.834619522094727,0],[111.53331756591797,-6.89120626449585,0],[111.77194213867188,-6.9033894538879395,0],[112.12046813964844,-6.940769672393799,0],[112.47845458984375,-7.009917736053467,0],[112.60857391357422,-7.117672443389893,0],[112.74022674560547,-7.247546672821045,0],[112.70453643798828,-7.447964668273926,0],[112.82825469970703,-7.657422065734863,0],[112.88208770751953,-7.701803684234619,0],[113.27635192871094,-7.85984468460083,0],[113.46625518798828,-7.891205787658691,0],[113.76237487792969,-7.896928787231445,0],[113.96504211425781,-7.813857078552246,0],[114.15202331542969,-7.8071064949035645,0],[114.43443298339844,-7.914538383483887,0],[114.45585632324219,-8.003471374511719,0],[114.34127044677734,-8.1943941116333,0],[114.2728271484375,-8.416982650756836,0],[114.53294372558594,-8.76599407196045,0],[114.30841827392578,-8.671136856079102,0],[113.94747924804688,-8.582942008972168,0],[113.67835235595703,-8.469120025634766,0],[113.27745056152344,-8.330151557922363,0],[113.03944396972656,-8.330666542053223,0],[112.77464294433594,-8.445645332336426,0],[112.6180191040039,-8.471402168273926,0],[112.29704284667969,-8.427604675292969,0],[111.6427993774414,-8.365459442138672,0],[110.98139953613281,-8.303335189819336,0],[110.61904907226562,-8.189713478088379,0],[110.24183654785156,-7.9744391441345215,0],[109.74728393554688,-7.82296895980835,0],[109.31901311116025,-7.721778710573102,0],[109.42067855728796,-6.9974124069131545,0]],[[118.14138793945312,-8.523038864135742,0],[118.00050354003906,-8.478849411010742,0],[117.90908813476562,-8.421843528747559,0],[117.88101959228516,-8.34564208984375,0],[117.8946533203125,-8.25027084350586,0],[118.00988006591797,-8.161042213439941,0],[118.15160369873047,-8.144957542419434,0],[118.22831726074219,-8.18599796295166,0],[118.25196838378906,-8.281407356262207,0],[118.33380889892578,-8.325596809387207,0],[118.4708023071289,-8.260415077209473,0],[118.62364959716797,-8.307647705078125,0],[118.67097473144531,-8.375872611999512,0],[118.66566467285156,-8.579111099243164,0],[118.7478256225586,-8.512320518493652,0],[118.82131958007812,-8.37537956237793,0],[118.96449279785156,-8.362363815307617,0],[119.06695556640625,-8.463837623596191,0],[119.0762710571289,-8.654491424560547,0],[119.15782928466797,-8.638274192810059,0],[119.1856918334961,-8.685505867004395,0],[119.17420959472656,-8.864015579223633,0],[119.03186798095703,-8.7694730758667,0],[118.8924789428711,-8.743234634399414,0],[118.82913208007812,-8.7694730758667,0],[118.8616943359375,-8.839272499084473,0],[118.47830200195312,-8.91001033782959,0],[118.41432189941406,-8.869186401367188,0],[118.45765686035156,-8.748480796813965,0],[118.41966247558594,-8.722241401672363,0],[118.28086853027344,-8.84294605255127,0],[118.17752075195312,-8.958403587341309,0],[118.0445175

or Karaton Singosari, Indonesian: Kerajaan Singhasari) was an Indianized Javanese Hindu–Buddhist kingdom located in east Java between 1222 and 1292 (today Indonesia). The kingdom succeeded the Kingdom of Kediri as the dominant kingdom in eastern Java. The kingdom's name cognate to Singosari district of Malang Regency, located several kilometres north of Malang city.\ninghasari was founded by Ken Arok (1182-1227/1247), whose story is a popular folktale in Central and East Java. Most of Ken Arok's life story and also the early history of Singhasari was taken from the Pararaton account, which also incorporates some mythical aspects. Ken Arok was an orphan born of a mother named Ken Endok and an unknown father (some tales stated he was a son of god Brahma) in Kediri kingdom’s territory.\n\nKen Arok rose from being a servant of Tungul Ametung, a regional ruler in Tumapel (present day Malang) to becoming ruler of Java from Kediri. He is considered the founder of the Rajasa dynasty of both the Singhasari and later the Majapahit line of monarchs.[1] He was assassinated by Anusapati, in revenge for killing his father, Tunggul Ametung.[2]:185–187 Ken Arok's son Panji Tohjaya assassinated Anusapati, but he in turn reigned only a few months in 1248 before his nephews revolted. These two, Ranga Wuni and Mahisha Champaka, ruled together under the names Vishnuvardhana and Narasimhamurti.\nIn the year 1275, the ambitious king Kertanegara, the fifth ruler of Singhasari who had been reigning since 1254, launched a peaceful naval campaign northward towards the weak remains of the Srivijaya[2]:198 in response to continuous Ceylon pirate raids and Chola kingdom's invasion from India which conquered Srivijaya’s Kedah in 1025. The strongest of these Malaya kingdoms was Jambi, which captured the Srivijaya capital in 1088, then the Dharmasraya kingdom, and the Temasek kingdom of Singapore, and then remaining territories.\n\nThe expedition is named the Pamalayu expedition was led by Admiral Mahesa Anabrang (a.k.a. Adwaya Brahman) to the Malaya region, and was also intended to secure the Malayan strait, the ‘Maritime Silk Road’ against potential Mongol invasion and ferocious sea pirates. These Malayan kingdoms then pledged allegiance to the king. King Kertanegara had long wished to surpass Srivijaya as a regional maritime empire, controlling sea trade routes from China to India.\n\nThe Pamalayu expedition from 1275 to 1292, from the time of Singhasari to Majapahit, is chronicled in the Javanese scroll Nagarakrtagama. Singhasari’s territory thus became Majapahit territory. In the year 1284, king Kertanegara made a hostile Pabali expedition to Bali, which integrated Bali into the Singhasari kingdom’s territory. The king also sent troops, expeditions and envoys to other nearby kingdoms such as the Sunda-Galuh kingdom, Pahang kingdom, Balakana kingdom (Kalimantan/Borneo), and Gurun kingdom (Maluku). He also established an alliance with the king of Champa (Vietnam).\n\nKing Kertanegara totally erased any Srivijayan influence from Java and Bali in 1290. However, the expansive campaigns exhausted most of the Kingdom’s military forces and in the future would stir a murderous plot against the unsuspecting King

The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.[9]:26–27\n\nGaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of Gaelic-speaking clerics working as missionaries.[9]:23–24 Operating in the sixth century on the island of Iona, Saint Columba was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.[13]:39 The Vikings began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. Old Norse entirely displaced Gaelic in the Northern Isles.[9]:29–30\n\nIn the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth I) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.[9]:31–32[17] The kingdom of Cináed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.[9]:32–33 From a base in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Spey, the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into Moray.[9]:34–35 Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.[9]:36–37\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with much of Scotland under the control of a single ruler and united by the Gaelic language, a modern nation-state first emerged, as did Scottish national consciousness.[10]:38 The domination of Gaelic was cracked during the reign of David I (1124–53), during which many English-speaking colonists settled in Scotland.[10]:39 David I and his successors also centralized royal power[10]:41–42 and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray, Galloway, and Caithness, although he did not succeed at extending his power over the Hebrides, which had been ruled by various Scottish clans following the death of Somerled in 1164.[10]:48–49 The system of feudalism was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king.[10]:53–54 The Scottish kings rejected English demands to subjugate themselves; in fact, England invaded Scotland several times to prevent the latter's expansion into northern England.\nThe death of Alexander III in March 1286 broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. Edward I of England arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown. In return for surrendering Scotland's nominal independence, John Balliol was pronounced king in 1292.[10]:47[18] In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the Auld Alliance. War ensued and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. Andrew Moray and William Wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the Wars of Scottish Independence,[19] until Robert the Bruce was crowned king of Scotland in 1306.[20] Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown. \nA civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the House of Stewart.[21]:77 The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages.

dispute over the succession to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy.[49] The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.[50] This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.[51]\n\nSubsequently, the House of Plantagenet from Anjou inherited the English throne under Henry II, adding England to the budding Angevin Empire of fiefs the family had inherited in France including Aquitaine.[52] They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V.[52] The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century[53] and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.\n\nDuring the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the House of Valois both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the House of Capet and with it France; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War.[54] The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's inhabitants.[55][56] From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family – the Yorkists and Lancastrians – known as the Wars of the Roses.[57] Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with

the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.[53] In 1130, the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws, which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. For periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.[54] The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of Håkon Håkonsson, who introduced clear law of succession.[55]\n\nFrom 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy percent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times and not being able to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century, about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.[56]\n\nThe 14th century is described as Norway's Golden Age, with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the High Middle Ages, the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.[57]\n\nIn 1349, the Black Death spread to Norway and had within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more animal husbandry. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,[58] and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some to mere farmers. High tithes to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the Council of State.\nThe Hanseatic League took control over Norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading center in Bergen. In 1380, Olaf Haakonsson inherited both the Norwegian and Danish thrones, creating a union between the two countries.[59] In 1397, under Margaret I, the Kalmar Union was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods, which resulted in a rebellion. However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.[60]\n\nMargaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark, because it had a greater population than Norway and Sweden combined.[61] Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of Lübeck in Bergen in return for recognition of her right to rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.[62] Even worse were the pirates, the \"Victual Brothers\", who launched three devastating raids on the port (the last in 1427).[63]\n\nNorway slipped ever more to the background under the Oldenburg dynasty (established 1448). There was one revolt under Knut Alvsson in 1502.[64] Norwegians had some affection for King Christian II, who resided in the country for several years. Norway took no part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the

the 8th to the 10th century the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern British Isles and Western Europe. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, and France where Danes and Norwegians founded Normandy with Rollo as head of state. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources as kings (reges). Under the reign of Gudfred in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the lands of Jutland, Scania and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.[32] The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to Gorm the Old, who established his reign in the early 10th century.[2] As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were Christianised around 965 by Harald Bluetooth, the son of Gorm. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire, which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.[31]\n\nThroughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (the areas of Scania, Halland, and Blekinge in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.\n\nIn 1397, Denmark entered into a personal union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I.[33] The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear \"senior\" partner of the union.[34] Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm. The Protestant Reformation spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count's Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536.

Roman Empire","color":"#ff8040","image":"250px-Quaterionenadler_David_de_Negker.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of prince-electors (Kurfürsten), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the Golden Bull of 1356, which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (Kaiser und Reich), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also their sons were to know the imperial languages – German, Latin, Italian, and Czech.[49][2]\n\nThe shift in power away from the emperor is also revealed in the way the post-Hohenstaufen kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called Reichsgut, which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the Reichsgut faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the Reichsgut was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the Reichsgut no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with Rudolf I of Germany increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the Reichsgut, which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and Styria to his own sons. In 1312, Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (Hausmacht): Louis IV of Wittelsbach (king 1314, emperor 1328–47) relied on his lands in Bavaria; Charles IV of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.","privateMemo":"Polygon92_HolyRomanEmpire","show":true}}]

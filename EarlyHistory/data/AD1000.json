Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture,[42] including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people.[43][44] Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon.[45] The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming,[46] a new style of pottery[47] and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.[48]\n\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han.[49] According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[50] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[51] Due to the defeat in Battle of Baekgang by Chinese Tang empire, Japanese government devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[52] The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn seemingly everything from the Chinese writing system, literature, religion, and architecture, to even dietary habits at this time. Even today, the impact of the reforms can still be seen in Japanese cultural life.After the reforms, the Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, two rivals to the throne, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[53] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central government and its subordinate local governments.[52] These legal reforms created the ritsuryō state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[53]\n\nThe Nara period (710–784) marked an emergence of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and architecture.[54] The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[55] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō, then to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[56]\n\nBuddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, Tendai by Saichō and Shingon by Kūkai. Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo-shū, Jōdo Shinshū) became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century.","privateMemo":"Polygon1_Japan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[120.82605743408203,21.942171096801758,0],[120.78024291992188,21.96748161315918,0],[120.73176574707031,22.11345863342285,0],[120.31710052490234,22.658824920654297,0],[120.16775512695312,23.103105545043945,0],[120.15394592285156,23.29998016357422,0],[120.22441864013672,23.636756896972656,0],[120.46998596191406,23.992958068847656,0],[121.06063842773438,24.82622528076172,0],[121.17686462402344,24.909048080444336,0],[121.36827087402344,24.966604232788086,0],[121.47129821777344,25.04939079284668,0],[121.63253021240234,25.151336669921875,0],[121.73502349853516,25.09440040588379,0],[121.98417663574219,24.917097091674805,0],[121.83403015136719,24.726245880126953,0],[121.79637145996094,24.662647247314453,0],[121.8067626953125,24.5229434967041,0],[121.7762222290039,24.24341583251953,0],[121.68519592285156,24.10984230041504,0],[121.60308074951172,23.950883865356445,0],[121.57374572753906,23.639610290527344,0],[121.52897644042969,23.41720962524414,0],[121.38607025146484,23.054882049560547,0],[121.17340087890625,22.736852645874023,0],[120.98564147949219,22.361713409423828,0],[120.97950744628906,22.20290756225586,0],[120.92830657958984,22.005903244018555,0],[120.82605743408203,21.942171096801758,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Taiwan","color":"#ff80c0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"","privateMemo":"Polygon2_Taiwan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-81.97356414794922,22.382883071899414,0],[-81.83690643310547,22.402240753173828,0],[-81.45892333984375,22.523813247680664,0],[-81.53572082519531,22.638078689575195,0],[-81.67611694335938,22.688623428344727,0],[-81.8419418334961,22.71371078491211,0],[-82.13508605957031,22.706724166870117,0],[-82.3587417602539,22.725332260131836,0],[-82.64907836914062,22.654788970947266,0],[-83.18601989746094,22.24046516418457,0],[-83.3530044555664,22.227386474609375,0],[-83.64688873291016,22.22676658630371,0],[-83.74163818359375,22.17571258544922,0],[-83.82683563232422,21.972116470336914,0],[-84.00495910644531,21.844614028930664,0],[-84.14879608154297,21.825233459472656,0],[-84.50273895263672,21.786563873291016,0],[-84.38623046875,21.932785034179688,0],[-84.17351531982422,22.073095321655273,0],[-84.23102569580078,22.339954376220703,0],[-84.10437774658203,22.511856079101562,0],[-84.05277252197266,22.55645751953125,0],[-83.48672485351562,22.831005096435547,0],[-82.75559997558594,23.042327880859375,0],[-82.23190307617188,23.081567764282227,0],[-81.85311126708984,23.152299880981445,0],[-81.4820327758789,23.134008407592773,0],[-81.22748565673828,23.153627395629883,0],[-80.89889526367188,23.078033447265625,0],[-80.5175552368164,23.040700912475586,0],[-80.24604034423828,22.952285766601562,0],[-79.99530029296875,22.901966094970703,0],[-79.78096008300781,22.89606475830078,0],[-79.55628967285156,22.775754928588867,0],[-79.2985610961914,22.53474998474121,0],[-79.12675476074219,22.420690536499023,0],[-78.86532592773438,22.34496307373047,0],[-78.51962280273438,22.294845581054688,0],[-77.96690368652344,22.137100219726562,0],[-77.50810241699219,21.91560173034668,0],[-77.30413818359375,21.77618408203125,0],[-77.13615417480469,21.528636932373047,0],[-76.98759460449219,21.46538543701172,0],[-76.77210235595703,21.446781158447266,0],[-76.00524139404297,21.213218688964844,0],[-75.5472412109375,21.137916564941406,0],[-75.40026092529297,21.030166625976562,0],[-75.55486297607422,20.76922035217285,0],[-75.44999694824219,20.699520111083984,0],[-75.19828033447266,20.68098258972168,0],[-74.85822296142578,20.71349334716797,0],[-74.6353988647461,20.637691497802734,0],[-74.40716552734375,20.46654510498047,0],[-74.14118194580078,20.339984893798828,0],[-73.9697265625,20.206865310668945,0],[-74.07449340820312,20.16851043701172,0],[-74.51597595214844,20.129426956176758,0],[-75.0335693359375,19.95035171508789,0],[-75.31539154052734,19.924325942993164,0],[-75.7896957397461,20.018665313720703,0],[-76.19479370117188,20.036867141723633,0],[-76.61502838134766,19.953338623046875,0],[-77.03948974609375,19.90158462524414,0],[-77.2571792602539,19.88840675354004,0],[-77.45928955078125,19.919761657714844,0],[-77.3004379272461,20.091726303100586,0],[-76.97294616699219,20.372106552124023,0],[-76.89506530761719,20.550247192382812,0],[-77.00623321533203,20.664432525634766,0],[-77.08751678466797,20.721467971801758,0],[-77.36756896972656,20.784433364868164,0],[-77.68267822265625,20.78376579284668,0],[-77.95372009277344,20.83403778076172,0],[-78.24669647216797,20.98597526550293,0],[-78.30996704101562,21.322738647460938,0],[-78.42588806152344,21.564041137695312,0],[-78.52421569824219,21.633760452270508,0],[-78.70222473144531,21.646085739135742,0],[-79.15444946289062,21.626060485839844,0],[-79.5308837890625,21.688825607299805,0],[-79.81036376953125,21.789936065673828,0],[-80.2405014038086,22.011503219604492,0],[-80.57283020019531,22.11886978149414,0],[-80.8495101928711,22.150060653686523,0],[-81.3686752319336,22.180744171142578,0],[-81.5886459350586,22.224775314331055,0],[-81.97

The Taíno name for the entire island was Haiti. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the Yanomami of the Amazon Basin. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the Caribs.[40]\n\nIn the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique, or chief, as the Europeans understood them.

AD 650. They engaged in farming and fishing[39] and hunting and gathering.[38] The fierce Caribs drove the Taíno to the northeastern Caribbean during much of the 15th century.[40] The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, including one hundred thousand,[41] three hundred thousand,[38] and four hundred thousand to two million.[42] Determining precisely how many people lived on the island in pre-Columbian times is next to impossible, as no accurate records exist.[43] By 1492 the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms.[44][45] The Taíno name for the entire island was either Ayiti or Quisqueya.[46]\n\nThe Spaniards arrived in 1492. After initially friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagaríx, Guamá, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after 1492 the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox,[47] measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans,[48] and from other causes discussed below.\n\nThe first recorded smallpox outbreak in the Americas occurred on Hispaniola in 1507.[48] The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived to an important extent, due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women,[49] and some present-day Dominicans have Taíno ancestry.[50][51] Remnants of the Taino culture include their cave paintings,[52] as well as pottery designs which are still used in the small artisan village of Higüerito, Moca.","privateMemo":"Polygon5_DominicanRepublic","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0],[-66.94828796386719,18.003496170043945,0],[-66.98090362548828,18.098773956298828,0],[-66.95801544189453,18.34671401977539,0],[-67.00691223144531,18.45465850830078,0],[-66.95732879638672,18.53103256225586,0],[-66.85150909423828,18.563047409057617,0],[-66.60694122314453,18.53178596496582,0],[-66.4251708984375,18.53853416442871,0],[-65.74784088134766,18.48912811279297,0],[-65.57134246826172,18.413232803344727,0],[-65.52041625976562,18.349777221679688,0],[-65.60482025146484,18.190698623657227,0],[-65.63636016845703,18.14613151550293,0],[-65.76368713378906,18.044166564941406,0],[-65.91475677490234,18.024778366088867,0],[-66.24720001220703,18.06219482421875,0],[-66.54269409179688,18.02979278564453,0],[-66.70193481445312,17.95318031311035,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Puerto Rico","color":"#41adf9","image":"250px-Taino_Village.JPG","religion":"","memo":"The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known. Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World (Aztec, Maya and Inca) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies, scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico's indigenous population. Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island.[44]\n\nThe first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people, an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland. Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years.[45] An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man, designated as the \"Puerto Ferro Man\", which was dated to around 2000 BC.[46] The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.[45]\n\nThe Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America. The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries.\n\nBetween the 7th and 11th centuries, the Taíno culture developed on the island. By approximately 1000 AD, it had become dominant. At the time of Columbus' arrival, an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians, led by the cacique (chief) Agüeybaná, inhabited the island. They called it Boriken, meaning \"the great land of the valiant and noble Lord\".[47] The natives lived in small villages, each led by a cacique. They subsisted by hunting and fishing, done generally by men, as well as by the women's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit. This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493.","privateMemo":"Polygon6_PuertoRico","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0],[-77.22164154052734,17.848072052001953,0],[-77.53367614746094,17.949106216430664,0],[-77.63683319091797,18.069660186767578,0],[-77.84814453125,18.234472274780273,0],[-78.05746459960938,18.272167205810547,0],[-78.12120056152344,18.36737632751465,0],[-77.88275146484375,18.495004653930664,0],[-77.56583404541016,18.527469635009766,0],[-76.95218658447266,18.414358139038086,0],[-76.51549530029297,18.256389617919922,0],[-76.22268676757812,18.1362361907959,0],[-76.0970230102539,18.00937843322754,0],[-76.11492156982422,17.920360565185547,0],[-76.26403045654297,17.88826560974121,0],[-76.60188293457031,18.021024703979492,0],[-76.84659576416016,17.995073318481445,0],[-76.94862365722656,17.88043785095215,0],[-77.08716583251953,17.822938919067383,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Jamaica","color":"#7b75f0","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Arawak and Taíno indigenous people, originating in South America, settled on the island between 4000 and 1000 BC.[13] When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494, there were more than 200 villages ruled by caciques (chiefs of villages).

Taino/Arawak.","privateMemo":"Polygon7_Jamaica","show":true}},{"Position":[[[48.21838149170799,-17.005801100871388,0],[47.685732073379896,-16.887434563465145,0],[46.857166311536204,-17.716000325308844,0],[45.4959511313644,-22.62821162766793,0],[45.732684206176884,-23.575143926917878,0],[46.20615035580186,-23.575143926917878,0],[47.389815729864296,-23.101677777292903,0],[48.69184764133296,-20.024147804730585,0],[48.69184764133296,-19.43231511769937,0],[48.21838149170799,-17.005801100871388,0]],[[44.87586212158203,-16.218608856201172,0],[45.12101745605469,-16.186298370361328,0],[45.40060043334961,-16.02045440673828,0],[45.4814453125,-16.032995223999023,0],[45.637210845947266,-16.077144622802734,0],[45.758235931396484,-16.038753509521484,0],[45.935935974121094,-15.873130798339844,0],[46.345947265625,-15.80870532989502,0],[46.48560333251953,-15.935513496398926,0],[46.622867584228516,-15.922507286071777,0],[46.668025970458984,-15.83979320526123,0],[46.59121322631836,-15.674713134765625,0],[46.93808364868164,-15.432455062866211,0],[47.128231048583984,-15.343074798583984,0],[47.273189544677734,-15.444453239440918,0],[47.448307037353516,-15.348734855651855,0],[47.309791564941406,-15.126596450805664,0],[47.40296936035156,-14.999290466308594,0],[47.62993621826172,-14.808127403259277,0],[47.733184814453125,-14.941375732421875,0],[47.83653259277344,-14.966580390930176,0],[48.08738327026367,-14.699111938476562,0],[48.016212463378906,-14.610283851623535,0],[47.90262222290039,-14.426219940185547,0],[47.944828033447266,-14.2926664352417,0],[48.054054260253906,-14.298788070678711,0],[48.17533493041992,-14.266746520996094,0],[48.252655029296875,-14.114058494567871,0],[48.11920928955078,-13.720303535461426,0],[48.146121978759766,-13.567718505859375,0],[48.260929107666016,-13.548397064208984,0],[48.31361389160156,-13.580066680908203,0],[48.42726135253906,-13.77684211730957,0],[48.55327606201172,-13.82105827331543,0],[48.643314361572266,-13.636557579040527,0],[48.95500183105469,-13.400738716125488,0],[49.0609016418457,-13.235267639160156,0],[49.12112808227539,-13.031769752502441,0],[49.19695281982422,-12.720187187194824,0],[49.137081146240234,-12.561429977416992,0],[49.13849639892578,-12.459737777709961,0],[49.37999725341797,-12.249496459960938,0],[49.54026412963867,-12.395319938659668,0],[49.74541473388672,-12.687226295471191,0],[50.020851135253906,-12.813741683959961,0],[50.08413314819336,-12.90259075164795,0],[50.17985153198242,-13.283707618713379,0],[50.31211471557617,-14.10327434539795,0],[50.35386657714844,-14.40189266204834,0],[50.45808410644531,-14.757577896118164,0],[50.633811950683594,-15.087686538696289,0],[50.70700454711914,-15.297257423400879,0],[50.68996810913086,-15.46254825592041,0],[50.65876007080078,-15.532525062561035,0],[50.632991790771484,-15.577067375183105,0],[50.390987396240234,-15.939858436584473,0],[50.29218673706055,-15.882871627807617,0],[50.20722198486328,-15.717802047729492,0],[49.95742416381836,-15.381494522094727,0],[49.82394790649414,-15.445340156555176,0],[49.8014030456543,-15.636051177978516,0],[49.88864517211914,-16.029909133911133,0],[50.06641387939453,-16.264686584472656,0],[50.10190200805664,-16.44257354736328,0],[49.96400451660156,-16.72887420654297,0],[49.62837219238281,-17.180837631225586,0],[49.60830307006836,-17.38425636291504,0],[49.62650680541992,-17.78462791442871,0],[49.54551696777344,-18.210649490356445,0],[49.226722717285156,-19.16468048095703,0],[48.85531997680664,-20.322233200073242,0],[48.29104232788086,-22.02678871154785,0],[47.69525909423828,-24.042858123779297,0],[47.46214294433594,-24.748859405517578,0],[47.37747573852539,-24.86344337463379,0],[47.14912796020508,-25.149944305419922,0],[47.05872344970703,-25.200979232788086,0],[46.44276428222656,-25.246767044067383,0],[45.993160247802734,-25.393905639648438,0],[45.77984619140625,-25.60410499572754,0],[45.41416931152344,-25.64301300048828,0],[45.2504768371582,-25.433609008789062,0],[45.16218185424805,-25.37023162841797,0],[44.916664123535156,-25.288116455078125,0],[44.75001525878906,-25.320247650146484,0],[44.62899398803711,-25.29507827758789,0],[44.24042510986328,-24.971744537353516,0],[44.19342041015625,-24.863798141479492,0],[44.18465805053711,-24.60958480834961,0],[44.1378288269043,-24.501638412475586,0],[43.93085479736328,-24.336816787719727,0],[43.87507629394531,-24.209815979003906,0],[43.8753776550293,-23.885677337646484,0],[44.030738830566406,-23.395952224731445,0],[43.9883918762207,-23.249862670898438,0],[43.859031677246094,-23.034042358398438,0],[43.58002853393555,-22.615154266357422,0],[43.49492645263672,-22.39287567138672,0],[43.52849197387695,-22.09409523010254,0],[43.704689025878906,-21.477214813232422,0],[43.806880950927734,-21.381662368774414,0],[44.020137786865234,-21.298583984375,0],[44.36531448364258,-20.681337356567383,0],[44.67399978637695,-20.153165817260742,0],[44.720760345458984,-20.006881713867188,0],[44.7890510559082,-19.510995864868164,0],[44.739402770996094,-19.352201461791992,0],[44.614162445068

finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BC.[66][67] Early Holocene humans might have existed on the island 10,500 years ago, based on grooves found on elephant bird bones left by humans.[68] However, a counter study concluded that human-made marks date to 1,200 years ago at the earliest, in which the previously mentioned bone damage may have been made by scavengers, ground movements or cuts from the excavation process.[69]\n\nTraditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350 BC and 550 AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the last major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans.[70]\n\nUpon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[71] By 600 AD, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[72] Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries.[73] A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000 AD. South Indian Tamil merchants arrived around 11th century. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds. [53] Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later.[72] The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.[53] The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.[74] Today, the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy

to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula. Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880.[19] In 2016, archeologists uncovered a longhouse in Stöðvarfjörður that has been dated to as early as 800.[20]\n\nSwedish Viking explorer Garðar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island.[21] He stayed over winter and built a house in Húsavík. Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men, Náttfari, decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of Iceland.[22][23]\n\nThe Norwegian-Norse chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson built his homestead in present-day Reykjavík in 874. Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their thralls, many of whom were Irish or Scottish.[24] By 930, most arable land on the island had been claimed; the Althing, a legislative and judicial assembly, was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth. Lack of arable land also served as an impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986.[25] The period of these early settlements coincided with the Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century.[26] At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day.[27] Christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000, although Norse paganism persisted among segments of the population for some years afterwards.","privateMemo":"Polygon9_Iceland","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-60.91058349609375,10.838654518127441,0],[-60.968326568603516,10.7376070022583,0],[-61.02033233642578,10.707269668579102,0],[-61.03333282470703,10.646595001220703,0],[-61.01599884033203,10.533912658691406,0],[-61.04199981689453,10.49490737915039,0],[-60.985660552978516,10.325884819030762,0],[-61.002994537353516,10.13519287109375,0],[-61.20669174194336,10.065850257873535,0],[-61.267364501953125,10.070184707641602,0],[-61.332374572753906,10.052848815917969,0],[-61.549068450927734,10.070184707641602,0],[-61.635746002197266,10.052848815917969,0],[-61.67475128173828,10.074518203735352,0],[-61.835105895996094,10.074518203735352,0],[-61.843772888183594,10.1005220413208,0],[-61.826438903808594,10.130859375,0],[-61.73542785644531,10.143860816955566,0],[-61.635746002197266,10.204535484313965,0],[-61.627079010009766,10.24354076385498,0],[-61.57940673828125,10.234872817993164,0],[-61.51006317138672,10.230539321899414,0],[-61.44939041137695,10.295547485351562,0],[-61.49272918701172,10.421231269836426,0],[-61.4710578918457,10.477572441101074,0],[-61.45805740356445,10.559916496276855,0],[-61.48839569091797,10.616256713867188,0],[-61.531734466552734,10.676931381225586,0],[-61.65741729736328,10.698601722717285,0],[-61.605411529541016,10.74194049835205,0],[-61.531734466552734,10.750608444213867,0],[-61.42771911621094,10.763609886169434,0],[-61.37571334838867,10.80261516571045,0],[-61.202354431152344,10.793947219848633,0],[-61.15468215942383,10.811283111572266,0],[-61.02033233642578,10.841620445251465,0],[-60.91058349609375,10.838654518127441,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Trinidad","color":"#ea4fcb","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Amerindians of South American origin.

Sardegna) is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus). It is located west of the Italian Peninsula and to the immediate south of the French island of Corsica.\nIn 533, Sardinia returned to the rule of the Byzantine Empire when the Vandals were defeated by the armies of Justinian I under the General Belisarius in the Battle of Tricamarum, in their African kingdom; Belisarius sent his general Cyril to Sardinia to retake the island. Sardinia remained in Byzantine hands for the next 300 years[38] aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the Ostrogoths in 551.\n\nUnder Byzantine rule, the island was divided into districts called mereíai (μερείαι) in Byzantine Greek, which were governed by a judge residing in Caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in Forum Traiani (today Fordongianus) under the command of a dux.[39] During this time, Christianity took deeper root on the island, supplanting the Paganism which had survived into the early Middle Ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands. Along with lay Christianity, the followers of monastic figures such as Basil of Caesarea became established in Sardinia. While Christianity penetrated the majority of the population, the region of Barbagia remained largely pagan and, probably, partially non-Latin speaking. They re-established a short-lived independent domain with Sardinian-heathen lay and religious traditions, one of its kings being Hospito.[40][41] Pope Gregory I wrote a letter to Hospito defining him \"Dux Barbaricinorum\" and, being Christian, the leader and best of his people.[42] In this unique letter about Hospito, the Pope prompts him to convert his people who \"living all like irrational animals, ignore the true God and worship wood and stone\" (Barbaricini omnes, ut insensata animalia vivant, Deum verum nesciant, ligna autem et lapides adorent).[43]\nThe dates and circumstances of the end of Byzantine rule in Sardinia are not known. Direct central control was maintained at least through c. 650, after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of Gregory the Patrician, Exarch of Africa and the first invasion of the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. There is some evidence that senior Byzantine administration in the Exarchate of Africa retreated to Caralis following the final fall of Carthage to the Arabs in 697.[44] The loss of imperial control in Africa led to escalating raids by Moors and Berbers on the island, the first of which is documented in 705, forcing increased military self-reliance in the province.[45] Communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the Muslim conquest of Sicily between 827 and 902. A letter by Pope Nicholas I as early as 864 mentions the \"Sardinian judges\",[46] without reference to the empire and a letter by Pope John VIII (reigned 872–882) refers to them as principes (\"princes\"). By the time of De Administrando Imperio, completed in 952, the Byzantine authorities no longer listed Sardinia as an imperial province, suggesting they considered it lost.[44] In all likelihood a local noble family, the Lacon-Gunale, acceded to the power of Archon, still identifying themselves as vassals of the Byzantines, but de facto independent as communications with Constantinople were very difficult. We know only two names of those rulers, Salusios (Σαλούσιος) and the protospatharios Turcoturios (Tουρκοτούριος) from two inscriptions[47][48][49]), who probably reigned between the 10th and the 11th century. These rulers were still closely linked to the Byzantines, both for a pact of ancient vassalage,[50] and from the ideological point of view, with the use of the Byzantine Greek language (in a Romance country), and the use of art of Byzantine inspiration.","privateMemo":"Polygon13_Sardinia\nサルデーニャ","show":true}},{"Position":[[[109.63331604003906,18.11359405517578,0],[109.14225006103516,18.34757423400879,0],[108.8555908203125,18.499420166015625,0],[108.7641372680664,19.077268600463867,0],[108.78056335449219,19.204343795776367,0],[108.88864135742188,19.31255531311035,0],[109.07734680175781,19.420930862426758,0],[109.40182495117188,19.701112747192383,0],[109.623779296875,19.676177978515625,0],[109.64591979980469,19.7524471282959,0],[109.75399017333984,19.93052864074707,0],[109.86132049560547,19.918058395385742,0],[110.11954498291016,19.816978454589844,0],[110.2642822265625,19.9570255279541,0],[110.46199035644531,19.957447052001953,0],[110.82101440429688,20.034433364868164,0],[111.08902740478516,19.7237548828125,0],[111.01547241210938,19.647382736206055,0],[110.81616973876953,19.4881591796875,0],[110.63069915771484,19.24639129638672,0],[110.50238037109375,18.915815353393555,0],[110.56513214111328,18.782548904418945,0],[110.46617889404297,18.64259910583496,0],[110.33497619628906,18.60420799255371,0],[109.87273406982422,18.43170738220215,0],[109.63331604003906,18.11359405517578,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hainan","color":"#9eb66c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Hainan","privateMemo":"Polygon14_Hainan","show":true}},{"Position":[[[31.48187863710113,-18.626967069998287,0],[32.89325966468361,-18.626967069998287,0],[33.59895017847485,-19.156234955341716,0],[33.59895017847485,-20.744038611372005,0],[33.06968229313142,-21.978997010506667,0],[31.30545600865332,-23.037532781193526,0],[29.541229724175224,-23.037532781193526,0],[28.659116581936175,-22.508264895850097,0],[28.482693953488365,-21.44972912516324,0],[28.835539210383985,-19.861925469132952,0],[29.894074981070844,-18.803389698446093,0],[31.48187863710113,-18.626967069998287,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Great Zimbabwe","color":"#64a7c3","image":"220px-Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Great Zimbabwe is a medieval city in the south-eastern hills of Zimbabwe near Lake Mutirikwe and the town of Masvingo. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe during the country's Late Iron Age. Construction on the monument began in the 11th century and continued until the 15th century.[1][2] The edifices were erected by the ancestral Shona.[2] The stone city spans an area of 7.22 square kilometres (1,780 acres) which, at its peak, could have housed up to 18,000 people. It is recognised as a World Heritage site by UNESCO.\n\nGreat Zimbabwe is believed to have served as a royal palace for the local monarch. As such, it would have been used as the seat of political power. Among the edifice's most prominent features were its walls, some of which were over five metres high. They were constructed without mortar (dry stone). Eventually, the city was abandoned and fell into ruin.\n\nThe earliest known written mention of the Great Zimbabwe ruins was in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, captain of the Portuguese garrison of Sofala, on the coast of modern-day Mozambique, who recorded it as Symbaoe. The first confirmed visits by Europeans were in the late 19th century, with investigations of the site starting in 1871.[3] Later, studies of the monument were controversial in the archaeological world, with political pressure being put upon archaeologists by the government of Rhodesia to deny its construction by native African people.[4] Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government, and the modern independent state was named after it. The word great distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins, now known as \"zimbabwes\", spread across the Zimbabwe Highveld.[5] There are 200 such sites in southern Africa, such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manyikeni in Mozambique, with monumental, mortarless walls; Great Zimbabwe is the largest of these.","privateMemo":"Polygon15_GreatZimbabwe","show":true}},{"Position":[[[44.50436019897461,1.307781457901001,0],[43.92797088623047,0.8172234296798706,0],[43.30299920765707,0.18699284727377868,0],[43.1448974609375,0.027560733258724213,0],[43.118446350097656,0,0],[42.64373016357422,-0.49460816383361816,0],[42.08784866333008,-1.2011849880218506,0],[41.81098556518555,-1.5767043828964233,0],[41.855865478515625,-1.7354810237884521,0],[41.81355667114258,-1.8597685098648071,0],[41.54298782348633,-2.034827470779419,0],[41.29227066040039,-2.111632823944092,0],[41.1190299987793,-2.0611681938171387,0],[41.080528259277344,-2.4107589721679688,0],[40.95347213745117,-2.5762572288513184,0],[40.65216827392578,-2.6277542114257812,0],[40.475006103515625,-2.7997190952301025,0],[40.435359954833984,-3.015862226486206,0],[40.438079833984375,-3.174734592437744,0],[40.27769470214844,-3.4546945095062256,0],[39.84379577636719,-4.065700054168701,0],[39.88506317138672,-4.307093620300293,0],[39.73347473144531,-4.599747180938721,0],[39.62103271484375,-4.714381217956543,0],[39.4709358215332,-4.759190559387207,0],[39.43278503417969,-4.8279218673706055,0],[39.326133728027344,-5.02004861831665,0],[39.137474060058594,-5.617815017700195,0],[39.07603073120117,-6.075499057769775,0],[39.12519073486328,-6.32323694229126,0],[39.42454147338867,-6.767434597015381,0],[39.77009201049805,-7.0272440910339355,0],[39.75908279418945,-7.154369354248047,0],[39.640869140625,-7.313498020172119,0],[39.47378921508789,-7.784121513366699,0],[39.49039840698242,-7.860354423522949,0],[39.62796401977539,-7.879120349884033,0],[39.681392669677734,-7.980677127838135,0],[39.604095458984375,-8.29223918914795,0],[39.59549331665039,-8.718043327331543,0],[39.78043746948242,-9.524735450744629,0],[39.86127853393555,-9.778766632080078,0],[40.0418815612793,-9.988092422485352,0],[40.41244888305664,-10.235139846801758,0],[40.59053039550781,-10.35550308227539,0],[40.669857025146484,-10.458283424377441,0],[40.72767639160156,-10.533150672912598,0],[40.82318115234375,-10.749017715454102,0],[40.740074157714844,-11.00976276397705,0],[40.60410690307617,-11.21341609954834,0],[39.45186132568498,-11.127899925987997,0],[38.44118558608735,-9.274994403392345,0],[37.93584771628853,-4.5585076186034,0],[39.620307282284564,-1.3580344432109115,0],[44.48507318232126,3.3747694927794427,0],[46.65295444068794,4.097396578901673,0],[47.840129116583775,4.1130139000851305,0],[47.760040283203125,4.009527206420898,0],[47.587650299072266,3.8117499351501465,0],[46.56416702270508,2.684803009033203,0],[46.429105551993416,2.5692746334849654,0],[45.74492645263672,1.984044075012207,0],[44.77113342285156,1.4799259901046753,0],[44.50436019897461,1.307781457901001,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Islamic

(/ˈkɔːrsɪkə/; French: Corse [kɔʁs]; Corsica in Corsican and Italian, pronounced [ˈkorsiga] and [ˈkɔrsika] respectively) is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 18 regions of France. It is located southeast of the French mainland and west of the Italian Peninsula, with the nearest land mass being the Italian island of Sardinia to the immediate south. A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island.\nIn the 5th century, the western half of the Roman Empire collapsed, and the island was invaded by the Vandals and the Ostrogoths.[2] Briefly recovered by the Byzantines, it soon became part of the Kingdom of the Lombards. This made it a dependency of the March of Tuscany, which used it as an outpost against the Saracens.[4] Pepin the Short, king of the Franks and Charlemagne's father, expelled the Lombards and nominally granted Corsica to Pope Stephen II.[4] In the first quarter of the 11th century, Pisa and Genoa together freed the island from the threat of Arab invasion.[4] After that, the island came under the influence of the republic of Pisa.[4] To this period belong the many polychrome churches which adorn the island, and Corsica also experienced a massive immigration from Tuscany, which gave to the island its present toponymy and rendered the language spoken in the northern two-thirds of the island very close to the Tuscan dialect.[4] Due to that, then began also the traditional division

Western Xia (Chinese: 西夏; pinyin: Xī Xià; Wade–Giles: Hsi1 Hsia4), also known as the Xi Xia Empire, to the Mongols as the Tangut Empire and to the Tangut people themselves and to the Tibetans as Mi-nyak,[3] was an empire which existed from 1038 to 1227 in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of Ningxia, Gansu, eastern Qinghai, northern Shaanxi, northeastern Xinjiang, southwest Inner Mongolia, and southernmost Outer Mongolia, measuring about 800,000 square kilometres (310,000 square miles).[4][5][6] The early capital was established at Yinchuan. By the 12th century Tangut power had shifted to Kharakhoto on the border of Mongolia with the destruction of Yinchuan in 1227 by the Mongols. Most of the written records and architecture were destroyed, so the founders and history of the empire remained obscure until 20th-century research in the West and in China.\n\nThe Western Xia occupied the area round the Hexi Corridor, a stretch of the Silk Road, the most important trade route between North China and Central Asia. They made significant achievements in literature, art, music, and architecture, which was characterized as \"shining and sparkling\".[7] Their extensive stance among the other empires of the Liao, Song, and Jin was attributable to their effective military organizations that integrated cavalry, chariots, archery, shields, artillery (cannons carried on the back of camels), and amphibious troops for combat on land and water.","privateMemo":"Polygon21_Xixia\n西夏","show":true}},{"Position":[[[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0],[80.54473876953125,5.986286640167236,0],[80.42581939697266,6.074979305267334,0],[80.33132934570312,6.2336320877075195,0],[80.2204360961914,6.512971878051758,0],[80.05775451660156,7.078125476837158,0],[80.04238891601562,7.370365619659424,0],[80.04439544677734,7.713481426239014,0],[80.03583526611328,8.12012004852295,0],[79.92784118652344,8.433548927307129,0],[80.01236724853516,8.66446304321289,0],[79.8782958984375,8.82190227508545,0],[79.90945434570312,8.947855949401855,0],[80.09967803955078,8.937359809875488,0],[80.25627899169922,9.13085651397705,0],[80.28018951416016,9.29610538482666,0],[80.3817367553711,9.462162017822266,0],[80.31324768066406,9.703569412231445,0],[80.55126190185547,9.487302780151367,0],[80.86608123779297,9.316428184509277,0],[80.9712905883789,9.138753890991211,0],[81.21858215332031,8.789820671081543,0],[81.29710388183594,8.643853187561035,0],[81.25273895263672,8.491267204284668,0],[81.26374053955078,8.427757263183594,0],[81.52980041503906,8.275839805603027,0],[81.6496353149414,7.94569206237793,0],[82.0085220336914,7.330141544342041,0],[82.06983184814453,7.10153341293335,0],[81.98268127441406,6.770936965942383,0],[81.80358123779297,6.46555233001709,0],[81.63754272460938,6.287286281585693,0],[81.4063491821289,6.096163272857666,0],[81.05546569824219,5.968320846557617,0],[80.76656341552734,5.948638439178467,0]],[[75.64353356598919,11.76677332587766,0],[76.87839411807698,13.302986348211741,0],[78.40664822182919,14.831240451963952,0],[80.66342163085938,15.790118217468262,0],[80.5038833618164,15.662714958190918,0],[80.36709594726562,15.40829086303711,0],[80.2930679321289,15.192127227783203,0],[80.29073333740234,14.96340560913086,0],[80.36532592773438,14.271071434020996,0],[80.37338256835938,13.908957481384277,0],[80.27955627441406,13.686388969421387,0],[80.38179016113281,13.540488243103027,0],[80.4055004842248,13.50865748528523,0],[80.52354431152344,13.35018539428711,0],[80.51712036132812,13.121453285217285,0],[80.42742156982422,12.848063468933105,0],[80.12647247314453,12.12313461303711,0],[80.07040792019772,11.986062996849936,0],[79.97301483154297,11.747947692871094,0],[79.92894345120735,11.532891058722637,0],[79.91439819335938,11.4619140625,0],[79.93549346923828,11.16969108581543,0],[80.0299301147461,10.375699996948242,0],[79.99360656738281,10.267605781555176,0],[79.70458221435547,10.266985893249512,0],[79.50993347167969,10.272917747497559,0],[79.4261474609375,10.20919418334961,0],[79.27594757080078,9.776823043823242,0],[79.1302719116211,9.509651184082031,0],[79.14138793945312,9.452491760253906,0],[79.36331176757812,9.29412841796875,0],[79.00131225585938,9.14720344543457,0],[78.8637924194336,9.140557289123535,0],[78.51750183105469,9.012736320495605,0],[78.38479614257812,8.828184127807617,0],[78.33943939208984,8.516746520996094,0],[78.26860809326172,8.402229309082031,0],[78.10342407226562,8.274786949157715,0],[78.05169146812739,8.249665755744896,0],[77.93759033700604,8.19425859750749,0],[77.8668441772461,8.159904479980469,0],[77.82227325439453,8.134393692016602,0],[77.7925033569336,8.115277290344238,0],[77.68805694580078,8.045159339904785,0],[77.62313842773438,8.045014381408691,0],[77.54503631591797,8.070255279541016,0],[76.90719604492188,8.723328590393066,0],[76.86605072021484,8.901147842407227,0],[76.74152374267578,9.135971069335938,0],[76.67087361373163,9.427097700471137,0],[76.58895111083984,9.764674186706543,0],[76.49766549273896,10.00191812663697,0],[76.45203945457197,10.120496510432202,0],[76.27872467041016,10.570927619934082,0],[75.85541534423828,11.440461158752441,0],[75.79436057392535,11.534489605081252,0],[75.64353356598919,11.76677332587766,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Chola state","color":"#4b89ea","image":"220px-Gopuram_Corner_View_of_Thanjavur_Brihadeeswara_Temple..JPG","religion":"","memo":"The Chola dynasty was one of the longest-ruling dynasties in history. The earliest datable references to this dynasty are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13). As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE.\n\nThe heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the Tungabhadra was united and held as one state for a period of two centuries and more.[2] Under Rajaraja Chola I and his successors Rajendra Chola I, Rajadhiraja Chola, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in South Asia and South-East Asia.[3] The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the Ganges which Rajendra Chola I undertook and by the naval raids on cities of the maritime empire of Srivijaya, as well as by the repeated embassies to China.[4] The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian sea power.\n\nDuring the period 1010–1153, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh.[5] Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of which is now Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river Ganges and defeated the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. He also successfully invaded cities of Srivijaya of Malaysia and Indonesia.[6] The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyan Dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.[7][8]\n\nThe Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal in the building of temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture.[3] The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity.[9][10] They pioneered a centralised form of government and established a disciplined bureaucracy. The Chola school of art spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.","privateMemo":"Polygon22_Cholastate","show":true}},{"Position":[[[102.29170419870674,34.88266253773643,0],[103.40692741187874,34.122321072003054,0],[103.35852976753438,33.2995611181487,0],[102.14011490339759,32.36783210439704,0],[100.8902499059713,31.412052988718123,0],[100.69665932859381,30.105316591420028,0],[100.8852925613553,28.707933606773693,0],[98.84088897705078,27.49571418762207,0],[96.63125720366641,26.71748148731386,0],[94.69535142989146,26.523890909936362,0],[94.35656791948084,27.685434374201336,0],[92.03393544916389,27.293726043425202,0],[86.61294482438103,27.34665086379072,0],[84.63215676756295,27.88992977908023,0],[83.94362195054356,28.221813467859356,0],[80.25764471256966,29.998507532206496,0],[80.01122730380531,30.726204702505786,0],[80.01122730380531,31.177846631332176,0],[80.28221246110115,31.900473717454403,0],[80.01122730380531,33.074742732403024,0],[80.1015556895706,34.06835497582109,0],[80.04895189989632,35.24214401678316,0],[80.03678593249822,35.51361265607722,0],[88.28935809276015,38.162586435914385,0],[87.88182366509291,38.67200447049846,0],[88.49312530659378,38.977655291248894,0],[92.77223679709998,38.773888077415265,0],[96.44004664610529,38.773888077415265,0],[97.66264992910706,38.57012086358164,0],[100.00597288819378,37.85693561516394,0],[102.2474122403637,37.755052008247134,0],[101.89123470685396,36.32435270840642,0],[102.29170419870674,34.88266253773643,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Tibet","color":"#ff8040","image":"170px-Songstengampo.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of Songtsen Gampo (604–650 CE), who united parts of the Yarlung River Valley and founded the Tibetan Empire. He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640 he married Princess Wencheng, the niece of the powerful Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China.[24]\n\nUnder the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia, while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the Tang's capital Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in late 763.[25] However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic Uyghur Khaganate.The Kingdom of Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.[26]\n\nIn 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.\n\nAt its height in the 780's to 790's the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.\n\nIn 821/822 CE Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.[27] Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the Era of Fragmentation, when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority.

Empire","color":"#50ec79","image":"170px-Song_Taizu.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Song dynasty (Chinese: 宋朝; pinyin: Sòng cháo; 960–1279) was an era of Chinese history that began in 960 and lasted until 1279. The dynasty was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song following his usurpation of the throne of the Later Zhou, ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song often came into conflict with the contemporary Liao and Western Xia dynasties in the north. It was conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Song government was the first in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder, as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass.\n\nThe Song dynasty is divided into two distinct periods, Northern and Southern. During the Northern Song (Chinese: 北宋; 960–1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now Kaifeng) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now Eastern China. The Southern Song (Chinese: 南宋; 1127–1279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of its northern half to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in the Jin–Song Wars. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the Yangtze and established its capital at Lin'an (now Hangzhou). Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional \"birthplace of Chinese civilization\" along the Yellow River, the Song economy was still strong, as the Southern Song Empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land. The Southern Song dynasty considerably bolstered its naval strength to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct maritime missions abroad. To repel the Jin, and later the Mongols, the Song developed revolutionary new military technology augmented by the use of gunpowder. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who took control of northern China, maintaining uneasy relations with the Southern Song. Möngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, died in 1259 while besieging the mountain castle Diaoyucheng, Chongqing. His younger brother Kublai Khan was proclaimed the new Great Khan, though his claim was only partially recognized by the Mongols in the west. In 1271, Kublai Khan was proclaimed the Emperor of China.[3] After two decades of sporadic warfare, Kublai Khan's armies conquered the Song dynasty in 1279. The Mongol invasion led to a reunification under the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368).[4]\n\nThe population of China doubled in size during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. This growth was made possible by expanded rice cultivation in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses.[5][6] The Northern Song census recorded 20 million households, double of the Han and Tang dynasties. It is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of some 120 million people,[7] and 200 million by the time of the Ming dynasty.[8] This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.\n\nSocial life during the Song was vibrant. Citizens gathered to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread of literature and knowledge was enhanced by the rapid expansion of woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable-type printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished over the course of the Song. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although the institution of the civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the exams became a leading factor in the shift from a military-aristocratic elite to a bureaucratic elite.","privateMemo":"Polygon24_SongEmpire\n宋","show":true}},{"Position":[[[101.21129944291619,21.440446645835152,0],[99.6319111530176,21.684126475498978,0],[98.7863109532533,25.417852743017026,0],[101.42262399375942,27.007867353380107,0],[103.16493919015687,26.814276776002608,0],[105.39123082999808,25.846323889115133,0],[106.78906405302246,22.93591209746377,0],[105.05244731958746,21.780921764187728,0],[104.76206145352121,20.18379950082339,0],[104.2296873657331,20.13540185647902,0],[103.99055206293582,20.238795551672265,0],[101.21129944291619,21.440446645835152,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Nan Chao","color":"#b3e459","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Nanzhao, also spelled Nanchao or Nan Chao, was a polity that flourished in what is now southern China and Southeast Asia during the 8th and 9th centuries. It was centered on present-day Yunnan in China.\nNanzhao encompassed many ethnic and linguistic groups. Some historians believe that the majority of the population were of the Bai people,[2] but that the elite spoke a variant of Nuosu (also called Yi), a Tibeto-Burman language closely related to Burmese.[3] The ruling elite of Nanzhao were descended from the Cuan clan who migrated from Taiyuan to Yunnan during Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign in 225. By the fourth century they had gained control of the region, but they rebelled against the Sui dynasty in 593 and were destroyed by a retaliatory expedition in 602. The Cuan split into two groups known as the Black and White Mywa.[4] The White Mywa tribes settled on the fertile land around the alpine fault lake Erhai. These tribes were called Mengshe (蒙舍), Mengsui (蒙嶲), Langqiong (浪穹), Dengtan (邆賧), Shilang (施浪), and Yuexi (越析). Each tribe had its own kingdom, known as a zhao. In 704 the Tibetan Empire made these kingdoms into vassals or tributaries.[4] In the year 737 AD, with the support of the Tang Dynasty of China, Piluoge (皮羅閣) of Mengshe united the six zhaos in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao (Mandarin, \"Southern Zhao\"). The capital was established in 738 at Taihe, (the site of modern-day Taihe village, a few miles south of Dali). Located in the heart of the Erhai valley, the site was ideal: it could be easily defended against attack and it was in the midst of rich farmland.[5]\n\nIn academia, the ethnic composition of the Nanzhao kingdom's population has been debated for a century. Chinese scholars tend to favour the theory that the rulers came from the aforementioned Bai or Yi groups, while some non-Chinese scholars subscribed to the theory that the Thai ethnic group was a major component, that later moved south into modern-day Thailand.","privateMemo":"Polygon25_NanChao\n南詔","show":true}},{"Position":[[[105.60338017178347,16.347951221631448,0],[105.13669708214886,17.46785468081627,0],[104.31494969295545,18.015686273611884,0],[103.26173447884563,18.015686273611884,0],[103.99055206293582,20.238795551672265,0],[104.2296873657331,20.13540185647902,0],[104.76206145352121,20.18379950082339,0],[105.05244731958746,21.780921764187728,0],[106.78906405302246,22.93591209746377,0],[107.62147521972656,21.2027587890625,0],[107.6694564819336,20.993242263793945,0],[107.5780029296875,20.897764205932617,0],[107.01070404052734,20.921977996826172,0],[106.94991302490234,20.832921981811523,0],[106.97523498535156,20.65511131286621,0],[106.84795379638672,20.48333740234375,0],[106.58458709716797,20.127059936523438,0],[106.48509216308594,20.063329696655273,0],[106.2453384399414,19.954822540283203,0],[106.16853332519531,19.89749526977539,0],[106.04705047607422,19.71938133239746,0],[105.91062927246094,19.29985237121582,0],[105.73624420166016,18.861183166503906,0],[105.85697937011719,18.759807586669922,0],[106.06779479980469,18.506168365478516,0],[106.56810760498047,18.02446937561035,0],[106.578857421875,17.916507720947266,0],[106.59750366210938,17.68151092529297,0],[106.63672637939453,17.567251205444336,0],[106.82592010498047,17.345327377319336,0],[107.2087391518182,17.054942464466286,0],[107.31863403320312,16.971582412719727,0],[107.57900869849956,16.708439964903313,0],[106.99490154888055,16.390095418006915,0],[106.65516105899701,16.204933273724176,0],[106.40758136122993,16.069999731551615,0],[105.60338017178347,16.347951221631448,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Annam","color":"#b44f88","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Annam (Chinese: 安南; pinyin: Ānnán; Vietnamese: An Nam) was the southernmost province of China after the Tang dynasty.

The empire, which grew out of the former kingdoms of Funan and Chenla, at times ruled over and/or vassalised most of mainland Southeast Asia[3] and parts of Southern China, stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province, China, and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar.[4][5]\n\nIts greatest legacy is Angkor, in present-day Cambodia, which was the site of the capital city during the empire's zenith. The majestic monuments of Angkor, such as Angkor Wat and Bayon, bear testimony to the Khmer Empire's immense power and wealth, impressive art and culture, architectural technique, aesthetics achievements, and the variety of belief systems that it patronised over time. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak in the 11th to 13th centuries, was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world.[6]\n\nThe beginning of the era of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802 CE when King Jayavarman II declared himself chakravartin (\"king of the world\", or \"king of kings\") on Phnom Kulen.

According to one study, Cham is related most closely to modern Acehnese in northern Sumatra.[8]\n\nTo the Han Chinese, the country of Champa was known as 林邑 Linyi[9] in Mandarin and Lam Yap in Cantonese and to the Vietnamese, Lâm Ấp (which is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of 林邑). It was founded in AD 192.[10][11]\n\nAround the 4th century AD, Champan polities began to absorb much of Indic influences, probably through its neighbour, Funan. Hinduism was established as Champa began to create Sanskrit stone inscriptions and erect red brick Hindu temples. The first king acknowledged in the inscriptions is Bhadravarman,[12][13] who reigned from AD 380 to AD 413. At Mỹ Sơn, King Bhadravarman established a linga called Bhadresvara,[4]:324 whose name was a combination of the king's own name and that of the Hindu god of gods Shiva.[14] The worship of the original god-king under the name Bhadresvara and other names continued through the centuries that followed.[15]\n\nRudravarman of Champa founded a new dynasty in 529 CE and was succeeded by his son Shambuvarman. Shambhuvarman reconstructed the temple of Bhadravarman and renamed it to Shambhu-bhadreshvara. He died in 629 and was succeeded by his son Kandarpadharma who died in 630-31. Kandarpadharma was succeeded by his son Prabhasadharma who died in 645.[16]\n\nBetween the 7th to 10th centuries AD, the Cham polities rose to become a naval power; as Champan ports attracted local and foreign traders, Champan fleets also controlled the trade in spices and silk in the South China Sea, between China, the Indonesian archipelago and India. They supplemented their income from the trade routes not only by exporting ivory and aloe, but also by engaging in piracy and raiding.[17] However, the rising influence of Champa caught the attention of a neighbouring thalassocracy that considered Champa as a rival, the Javanese (Javaka, probably refers to Srivijaya ruler of Sumatra and Java).

The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant.[2] The thousand-year period, often referred to as the Pyu millennium, linked the Bronze Age to the beginning of the classical states period when the Pagan Kingdom emerged in the late 9th century.\n\nThe city-states—five major walled cities and several smaller towns have been excavated—were all located in the three main irrigated regions of Upper Burma: the Mu River Valley, the Kyaukse plains and Minbu region, around the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Part of an overland trade route between China and India, the Pyu realm gradually expanded south. Halin, founded in the 1st century AD at the northern edge of Upper Burma, was the largest and most important city until around the 7th or 8th century when it was superseded by Sri Ksetra (near modern Pyay) at the southern edge. Twice as large as Halin, Sri Ksetra was the largest and most influential Pyu centre.[2]\n\nThe Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on the Culture of Burma and political organisation.[3] The Pyu calendar, based on the Buddhist calendar, later became the Burmese calendar. Recent scholarship, though yet not settled, suggests that the Pyu script, based on the Indian Brahmi script, may have been the source of the Burmese script used to write the Burmese language.\n\nThe millennium-old civilisation came crashing down in the 9th century when the city-states were destroyed by repeated invasions from the Kingdom of Nanzhao. The Bamar people, who came from Nanzhao, set up a garrison town at Bagan at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers. Pyu settlements remained in Upper Burma for the next three centuries but the Pyu gradually were absorbed into the expanding Pagan Kingdom. The Pyu language still existed until the late 12th century. By the 13th century, the Pyu had assumed the Burman ethnicity. The histories and legends of the Pyu were also incorporated to those of the Bamar.[3]\n\nOnly the city-states of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, where

Indonesian city-state based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, which influenced much of Southeast Asia.[2] Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 8th to the 12th century. Srivijaya was the first unified kingdom to dominate much of Indonesian archipelago.[3] The rise of the Srivijayan Empire is seen to run parallel to the end of the Malay sea-faring period. Due to its location, this once powerful state developed complex technology utilizing maritime resources. In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, thus transforming it into a prestige goods based economy.[4]\n\nThe earliest reference to it dates from the 7th century. A Tang Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 for six months.[5][6] The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, dated 16 June 682.[7] Between the late 7th and early 11th century, Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring Java, Kambuja and Champa. Srivijaya's main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East.\n\nThe kingdom ceased to exist in the 13th century due to various factors, including the expansion of the rival Javanese Singhasari and Majapahit empires.[2] After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. It was not until 1918 that French historian George Cœdès, of École française d'Extrême-Orient, formally postulated its existence.","privateMemo":"Polygon31_SrivijayaEmpire\nシュリーヴィジャヤ王国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0],[129.8449249267578,41.672821044921875,0],[129.79437255859375,41.48687744140625,0],[129.83473205566406,41.294761657714844,0],[129.76507568359375,41.08966064453125,0],[129.68148803710938,40.698997497558594,0],[129.38070678710938,40.647193908691406,0],[129.218505859375,40.54449462890625,0],[128.99468994140625,40.37131118774414,0],[128.65025329589844,40.08283996582031,0],[128.4398956298828,39.98656463623047,0],[128.13497924804688,39.97319793701172,0],[127.87519073486328,39.88340759277344,0],[127.75605010986328,39.781131744384766,0],[127.64446258544922,39.640628814697266,0],[127.48055267333984,39.2386589050293,0],[127.60822296142578,39.09231185913086,0],[128.15968322753906,38.71104431152344,0],[128.34780883789062,38.551605224609375,0],[128.65472412109375,38.272396087646484,0],[129.18458557128906,37.54737854003906,0],[129.3329315185547,37.3248291015625,0],[129.4536590576172,37.025848388671875,0],[129.4544677734375,36.688499450683594,0],[129.43899536132812,36.2620964050293,0],[129.38121032714844,35.975669860839844,0],[129.44540405273438,35.92491149902344,0],[129.67044067382812,35.9444580078125,0],[129.61590576171875,35.75986862182617,0],[129.48892211914062,35.524269104003906,0],[129.26368713378906,35.1867561340332,0],[129.1214141845703,35.04658126831055,0],[129.01217651367188,35.02728271484375,0],[128.75662231445312,35.122135162353516,0],[128.6416778564453,35.077392578125,0],[128.36814880371094,34.816436767578125,0],[128.1743621826172,34.8541374206543,0],[128.04415893554688,34.95543670654297,0],[127.79966735839844,34.91050338745117,0],[127.56275939941406,34.82115173339844,0],[127.02812194824219,34.445526123046875,0],[126.82044982910156,34.426063537597656,0],[126.61324310302734,34.28597640991211,0],[126.58869171142578,34.53985595703125,0],[126.56380462646484,34.6858024597168,0],[126.49030303955078,35.0030517578125,0],[126.4290771484375,35.180965423583984,0],[126.50396728515625,35.38462448120117,0],[126.72863006591797,35.5949592590332,0],[126.72843933105469,35.75398254394531,0],[126.8301010131836,35.94502639770508,0],[126.8105239868164,36.00860595703125,0],[126.64036560058594,36.148231506347656,0],[126.59749603271484,36.28176498413086,0],[126.60427856445312,36.49177551269531,0],[126.56510162353516,36.64443588256836,0],[126.43516540527344,36.701454162597656,0],[126.1639404296875,36.739097595214844,0],[126.45846557617188,36.92428207397461,0],[126.59459686279297,36.97548294067383,0],[126.8890151977539,36.85514450073242,0],[127.00328826904297,36.96358871459961,0],[126.98999786376953,37.09087371826172,0],[126.6466293334961,37.49129867553711,0],[126.59552001953125,37.63129425048828,0],[126.53409576416016,37.67840576171875,0],[126.41338348388672,37.77102279663086,0],[126.25616455078125,37.61787796020508,0],[126.1126708984375,37.52842712402344,0],[125.94483184814453,37.80192565917969,0],[125.7654037475586,37.85251998901367,0],[125.47303771972656,37.50165557861328,0],[125.38526916503906,37.67341613769531,0],[125.28062438964844,37.787845611572266,0],[124.97338104248047,37.95282745361328,0],[124.89732360839844,38.15651321411133,0],[124.93985748291016,38.2967529296875,0],[125.13301849365234,38.481910705566406,0],[125.47227478027344,38.58455276489258,0],[125.49740600585938,38.70567321777344,0],[125.2315902709961,38.83259201049805,0],[125.41454315185547,39.2281379699707,0],[125.499755859375,39.38129806518555,0],[125.41020202636719,39.502254486083984,0],[125.1259994506836,39.63557815551758,0],[125.0636215209961,39.63545227050781,0],[124.89208984375,39.62234878540039,0],[124.75175476074219,39.558311462402344,0],[124.6465072631836,39.5899772644043,0],[124.41265106201172,39.75529861450195,0],[124.3375473022461,39.86011505126953,0],[124.3144550752912,39.89237442539795,0],[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Korea","color":"#bc37ec","image":"150px-Changdeokgung_Garden_Pavillion_(1509046103).jpg","religion":"","memo":"In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, a descendant of Goguryeo nobility,[99] who established Goryeo as the successor state of Goguryeo.[29][30][31][32] Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in 926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo.[100] Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type printing press.[40][41][42][43][44][101][102] After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time,[103][104] in the Goryeo–Khitan War, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing, promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science; by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.[105][106] However, the Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to Kublai Khan, who accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince.[107] Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses,[107] and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess.[108][self-published source] In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered Liaoyang, and defeated invasions by the Red Turbans. However, in 1392, General Yi Seong-gye, who had been ordered to attack China, turned his army around and staged a coup.","privateMemo":"Polygon32_Korea","show":true}},{"Position":[[[132.06881713867188,43.30735397338867,0],[131.78787231445312,43.22969436645508,0],[131.56045532226562,43.01082229614258,0],[131.26828002929688,42.766212463378906,0],[130.67127990722656,42.315757751464844,0],[130.63876342773438,42.293731689453125,0],[130.02838134765625,41.87833786010742,0],[124.3144550752912,39.89237442539795,0],[124.3077392578125,39.901756286621094,0],[124.12019348144531,39.82485580444336,0],[123.5700912475586,39.766361236572266,0],[123.24272155761719,39.68917465209961,0],[122.23115539550781,39.27273178100586,0],[121.94683074951172,39.10641860961914,0],[121.69207000732422,38.89557647705078,0],[121.4201431274414,38.773929595947266,0],[121.26899719238281,38.76725387573242,0],[121.32736206054688,38.88209533691406,0],[121.71543884277344,39.1888313293457,0],[121.86381530761719,39.348487854003906,0],[121.65262603759766,39.39907455444336,0],[121.48583984375,39.36686325073242,0],[121.41700744628906,39.5006103515625,0],[121.44306945800781,39.570804595947266,0],[121.87179565429688,39.92237854003906,0],[121.9926528930664,40.09505081176758,0],[122.24018096923828,40.281009674072266,0],[122.31157684326172,40.37069320678711,0],[122.28601837158203,40.50498580932617,0],[121.95728302001953,40.75392532348633,0],[121.6303939819336,40.88129806518555,0],[121.5716781616211,40.8875846862793,0],[121.2889404296875,40.87420654296875,0],[121.21427154541016,40.867652893066406,0],[120.9920883178711,40.70078659057617,0],[120.47640991210938,40.16874313354492,0],[120.31639099121094,40.09807586669922,0],[120.02748107910156,40.05913543701172,0],[119.75144958496094,39.950016021728516,0],[119.58915710449219,39.86040496826172,0],[119.41433715820312,39.65599822998047,0],[119.35308074951172,39.470951080322266,0],[119.29425811767578,39.356075286865234,0],[119.18130493164062,39.24110794067383,0],[118.98493194580078,39.18333053588867,0],[118.76300048828125,39.18925857543945,0],[118.61609649658203,39.06785202026367,0],[118.47825622558594,39.01658248901367,0],[118.27359008789062,39.27116012573242,0],[118.11377716064453,39.27721405029297,0],[117.95655059814453,39.21950912475586,0],[117.77871704101562,38.932308197021484,0],[117.71376698131385,38.7825414091061,0],[115.89981556721679,39.58895693274978,0],[111.6207040767106,39.58895693274978,0],[110.70375161445926,39.894607753500225,0],[109.5830319383743,41.219094643418806,0],[108.56419586920617,41.52474546416925,0],[114.03195199847269,43.263711257004395,0],[120.28724011080708,43.82111316800449,0],[123.81745221380766,44.006913805004515,0],[127.781199136475,44.440448624671255,0],[132.1165473331424,46.54618917733828,0],[133.23135115514256,46.54618917733828,0],[133.91262015747603,45.43138535533809,0],[133.60295242914265,44.68818280733797,0],[132.06881713867188,43.30735397338867,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Liao","color":"#d0586f","image":"220px-Tianning_Temple_Pagoda.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Liao dynasty (/ljaʊ/;[5] Khitan: Mos Jælud; traditional Chinese: 遼朝; simplified Chinese: 辽朝; pinyin: Liáo cháo),[6] also known as the Liao Empire, officially the Great Liao (大遼; 大辽; Dà Liáo), or the Khitan (Qidan) State (Khitan: Mos diau-d kitai huldʒi gur),[7] was an empire in East Asia that ruled from 907 to 1125 over present-day Northern and Northeast China, Mongolia and portions of the Russian Far East and North Korea.[8] The empire was founded by Yelü Abaoji, Khagan of the Khitans around the time of the collapse of Tang China and was the first state to control all of Manchuria.[9]\n\nAlmost immediately after its founding, the Khitan Empire began a process of territorial expansion, with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae. Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Later Tang (923–936) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo after losing in Goryeo–Khitan Wars (1018) against Goryeo.[10] In 1004, Liao Dynasty launched an imperial expedition against the Northern Song. After heavy fighting and large casualties between two countries, the two sides worked out the Chanyuan Treaty. Through the treaty Liao forced the Northern Song to recognize them as peers.\n\nTension between traditional Khitan social and political practices and Chinese influence and customs was a defining feature of the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while much of the rest of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.\n\nDifferences between Chinese and Khitan society included gender roles and marital practices: the Khitans took a more egalitarian view towards gender, in sharp contrast to Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women were not required to be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.\n\nThe Liao dynasty was destroyed by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, and a number of various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain

sent his cousin Ali to Sana'a and its surroundings around 630 CE. At the time, Yemen was the most advanced region in Arabia.[91] The Banu Hamdan confederation was among the first to accept Islam. Muhammed sent Muadh ibn Jabal, as well to Al-Janad, in present-day Taiz, and dispatched letters to various tribal leaders. The reason behind this was the division among the tribes and the absence of a strong central authority in Yemen during the days of the prophet.\nMajor tribes, including Himyar, sent delegations to Medina during the \"year of delegations\" around 630–631 CE. Several Yemenis accepted Islam before the year 630, such as Ammar ibn Yasir, Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Musa Ashaari, and Sharhabeel ibn Hasana. A man named 'Abhala ibn Ka'ab Al-Ansi expelled the remaining Persians and claimed he was a prophet of Rahman. He was assassinated by a Yemeni of Persian origin called Fayruz al-Daylami. Christians, who were mainly staying in Najran along with Jews, agreed to pay jizyah (Arabic: جِـزْيَـة‎), although some Jews converted to Islam, such as Wahb ibn Munabbih and Ka'ab al-Ahbar.\n\nYemen was stable during the Rashidun Caliphate. Yemeni tribes played a pivotal role in the Islamic expansion of Egypt, Iraq, Persia, the Levant, Anatolia, North Africa, Sicily, and Andalusia.[93][94][95] Yemeni tribes who settled in Syria, contributed significantly to the solidification of Umayyad rule, especially during the reign of Marwan I. Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kindah were on his side during the Battle of Marj Rahit.[96][97]\n\nSeveral emirates led by people of Yemeni descent were established in North Africa and Andalusia. Effective control over entire Yemen was not achieved by the Umayyad Caliphate. Imam Abdullah ibn Yahya Al-Kindi was elected in 745 CE to lead the Ibāḍī movement in Hadramawt and Oman. He expelled the Umayyad governor from Sana'a and captured Mecca and Medina in 746.[98] Al-Kindi, known by his nickname \"Talib al-Haqq\" (seeker of truth), established the first Ibadi state in the history of Islam, but was killed in Taif around 749.[98]\n\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ziyad founded the Ziyadid dynasty in Tihama around 818 CE. The state stretched from Haly (in present-day Saudi Arabia) to Aden. They nominally recognized the Abbasid Caliphate, but were in fact ruling independently from their capital in Zabid.[99] The history of this dynasty is obscure. They never exercised control over the highlands and Hadramawt, and did not control more than a coastal strip of the Yemen (Tihama) bordering the Red Sea.[100] A Himyarite clan called the Yufirids established their rule over the highlands from Saada to Taiz, while Hadramawt was an Ibadi stronghold and rejected all allegiance to the Abbasids in Baghdad.[99] By virtue of its location, the Ziyadid dynasty of Zabid developed a special relationship with Abyssinia. The chief of the Dahlak islands exported slaves, as well as amber and leopard hides, to the then ruler of Yemen.[101]\n\nThe first Zaidi imam, Yahya ibn al-Husayn, arrived in Yemen in 893 CE. He was the founder of the Zaidi imamate in 897. He was a religious cleric and judge who was invited to come to Saada from Medina to arbitrate tribal disputes.[102] Imam Yahya persuaded local tribesmen to follow his teachings. The sect slowly spread across the highlands, as the tribes of Hashid and Bakil, later known as \"the twin wings of the imamate,\" accepted his authority.[103]\n\nYahya established his influence in Saada and Najran. He also tried to capture Sana'a from the Yufirids in 901 CE, but failed miserably. In 904, the Qarmatians invaded Sana'a. The Yufirid emir As'ad ibn Ibrahim retreated to Al-Jawf, and between 904 and 913, Sana'a was conquered no less than 20 times by Qarmatians and Yufirids.[104] As'ad ibn Ibrahim regained Sana'a in 915. Yemen was in turmoil as Sana'a became a battlefield for the three dynasties, as well as independent tribes.\n\nThe Yufirid emir Abdullah ibn Qahtan attacked and burned Zabid in 989, severely weakening the Ziyadid dynasty.[105] The Ziyadid monarchs lost effective power after 989, or even earlier than that. Meanwhile, a succession of slaves held power in Zabid and continued to govern in the name of their masters, eventually establishing their own dynasty around 1022 or 1050 according to different sources.[106] Although they were recognized by the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, they ruled no more than Zabid and four districts to its north.[107] The rise of the Ismaili Shia Sulayhid dynasty in the Yemeni highlands reduced their history to a series of intrigues.","privateMemo":"Polygon35_Yemen","show":true}},{"Position":[[[47.26758976979487,15.765216980999796,0],[48.04125031682607,16.43865430180214,0],[50.71479905078823,17.163684466944417,0],[52.019073721113095,18.141890469688065,0],[54.14221333879601,19.171561992667034,0],[56.92922289379648,19.171561992667034,0],[57.38987350463867,18.955080032348633,0],[57.107975006103516,18.833772659301758,0],[56.94255065917969,18.706348419189453,0],[56.81226348876953,18.483713150024414,0],[56.75302505493164,18.235801696777344,0],[56.661216735839844,18.10853385925293,0],[56.46125411987305,17.993745803833008,0],[56.21650695800781,17.94875717163086,0],[56.085208892822266,17.948482513427734,0],[55.911781311035156,17.96715545654297,0],[55.76473617553711,17.954143524169922,0],[55.5931510925293,17.82671356201172,0],[55.49407196044922,17.693071365356445,0],[55.4380989074707,17.4642333984375,0],[55.439300537109375,17.30540657043457,0],[55.398502349853516,17.165536880493164,0],[55.11427688598633,16.987031936645508,0],[54.95974349975586,16.96764373779297,0],[54.610538482666016,17.062192916870117,0],[54.28792190551758,17.036090850830078,0],[53.88491439819336,16.914512634277344,0],[53.539398193359375,16.780351638793945,0],[53.41211700439453,16.735605239868164,0],[53.224613189697266,16.670740127563477,0],[53.09798812866211,16.626924514770508,0],[52.855831146240234,16.505691528320312,0],[52.56026077270508,16.250917434692383,0],[52.441307067871094,16.11722755432129,0],[52.366519927978516,15.888344764709473,0],[52.33883285522461,15.704031944274902,0],[52.154075622558594,15.557498931884766,0],[51.802665540587974,15.39572562522666,0],[51.51622772216797,15.263862609863281,0],[50.494781494140625,14.975756645202637,0],[49.916526794433594,14.790260314941406,0],[49.537513732910156,14.649667739868164,0],[49.3768424987793,14.515887260437012,0],[49.1640510559082,14.235869407653809,0],[49.08296009080626,14.185691963525354,0],[47.26758976979487,15.765216980999796,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Hadramaut","color":"#56eada","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Hadramaut, Hadhramaut, Hadramout, Hadramawt (Arabic: حَضْرَمَوْت‎, translit.

This made it easy for the remaining Georgian realms to fall prey to the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century.\n\nThe extinction of the different Iberian royal dynasties, such as Guaramids and the Chosroids,[36] and also the Abbasid preoccupation with their own civil wars and conflict with the Byzantine Empire, let the Bagrationi family to grown in prominence. The head of the Bagrationi dynasty Ashot I of Iberia (r.813–826), who had migrated to the former southwestern territories of Iberia, came to rule over Tao-Klarjeti and restored the Principate of Iberia in 813. The sons and grandsons of Ashot I established three separate branches, frequently struggling with each other and with neighboring rulers. The Kartli line prevailed; in 888 Adarnase IV of Iberia (r.888–923) restored the indigenous royal authority dormant since 580. Despite the revitalization of the Iberian monarchy, remaining Georgian lands were divided among rival authorities, with Tbilisi remaining in Arab hands.\nAn Arab incursion into western Georgia led by Marwan II, was repelled by Leon I (r.720–740) jointly with his Lazic and Iberian allies in 736. Leon I then married Mirian’s daughter, and a successor, Leon II exploited this dynastic union to acquire Lazica in the 770s.[37] The successful defense against the Arabs, and new territorial gains, gave the Abkhazian princes enough power to claim more autonomy from the Byzantine Empire. Towards circa 778, Leon II (r.780–828) won his full independence with the help of the Khazars and was crowned as the king of Abkhazia. After obtaining of the state independence, the matter of the church independence became the main problem. In the early 9th century Abkhazian Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicate of Mtskheta; Georgian language replaced Greek as the language of literacy and culture.[38][39] The most prosperous period of the Abkhazian kingdom was between 850 and 950. A bitter civil war and feudal revolts which began under Demetrius III (r. 967–975) led the kingdom into complete anarchy under the unfortunate king Theodosius III the Blind (r.975–978). A period of unrest ensued, which ended as Abkhazia and eastern Georgian states were unified under a single Georgian monarchy, ruled by King Bagrat III of Georgia (r.975–1014), due largely to the diplomacy and conquests of his energetic foster-father David III of Tao (r. 966–1001).","privateMemo":"Polygon41_Georgia","show":true}},{"Position":[[[43.52867337743156,40.970315980811996,0],[45.63558988349731,41.47597594226778,0],[46.351941495559664,39.70616607717255,0],[47.02615477750071,38.35773951329046,0],[47.11043143774334,37.936356212077314,0],[47.02615477750071,37.68352623134942,0],[45.71986654373994,37.051451279529694,0],[45.0456532617989,36.798621298801805,0],[44.66640829070706,36.840759628923124,0],[42.22238514367079,38.14704786268389,0],[41.21106522075923,38.35773951329046,0],[42.011693493064215,38.694846154260986,0],[42.22238514367079,39.20050611571676,0],[42.51735345451999,40.001134388021754,0],[42.89659842561183,40.71748600008411,0],[43.52867337743156,40.970315980811996,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Armenia","color":"#e1ea44","image":"220px-Etchmiadzin_cathedral.jpg","religion":"","memo":"After the Sasanian period (428–636), Armenia emerged as Arminiya, an autonomous principality under the Umayyad Caliphate, reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the Byzantine Empire as well. The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognised by the Caliph and the Byzantine Emperor. It was part of the administrative division/emirate Arminiya created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and Caucasian Albania, and had its centre in the Armenian city, Dvin. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened Abbasid Caliphate under Ashot I of Armenia.\n\nThe reemergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the Bagratuni dynasty and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the Bagratid Armenia separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of Vaspurakan ruled by the House of Artsruni in the south, Kingdom of Syunik in the east, or Kingdom of Artsakh on the territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh, while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.\nIn 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia. Soon, the other Armenian states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short lived, as in 1071 the Seljuk Empire defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia at the Battle of Manzikert, establishing the Seljuk Empire.[57] To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, Gagik II of Armenia, King of Ani, an Armenian named Ruben I, Prince of Armenia, went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the Taurus Mountains and then into Tarsus of Cilicia. The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under Leo I, King of Armenia, a descendant of Prince Ruben.\n\nCilicia was a strong ally of the European Crusaders, and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region.\n\nThe Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse. In the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the Zakarid family drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent principality in northern and eastern Armenia known as Zakarid Armenia, which lasted under the patronage of the Georgian Kingdom. The Orbelian Dynasty shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in Syunik and Vayots Dzor, while the House of Hasan-Jalalyan controlled provinces of Artsakh and Utik

Shia Iranian dynasty[7] of Daylamite origin.[8] Coupled with the rise of other Iranian dynasties in the region, the approximate century of Buyid rule represents the period in Iranian history sometimes called the 'Iranian Intermezzo' since, after the Muslim conquest of Persia, it was an interlude between the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Seljuk Empire.[9]\n\nThe Buyid dynasty was founded by 'Ali ibn Buya, who in 934 conquered Fars and made Shiraz his capital, while his younger brother Hasan ibn Buya conquered parts of Jibal in the late 930s, and by 943 managed to capture Ray, which he made his capital. In 945, the youngest brother, Ahmad ibn Buya, conquered Iraq and made Baghdad his capital, receiving the honorific title of \"Mu'izz al-Dawla\" (\"Fortifier of the State\"), while 'Ali was given the title of \"'Imad al-Dawla\" (\"Support of the State\"), and Hasan was given the title of \"Rukn al-Dawla\" (\"Pillar of the State\").\n\nAs Daylamite Iranians the Buyids consciously revived symbols and practices of Iran's Sasanian Empire.[10] In fact, beginning with 'Adud al-Dawla they used the ancient Sasanian title Shahanshah (شاهنشاه), literally \"king of kings\".[11][12]\n\nAt its greatest extent, the Buyid dynasty encompassed most of today's Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Syria, along with parts of Oman , the UAE, Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Empire","color":"#ff0000","image":"140px-Heraclius_613-616.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The accession of Basil I to the throne in 867 marks the beginning of the Macedonian dynasty, which would rule for the next two and a half centuries. This dynasty included some of the most able emperors in Byzantium's history, and the period is one of revival and resurgence. The Empire moved from defending against external enemies to reconquest of territories formerly lost.[86]\n\nIn addition to a reassertion of Byzantine military power and political authority, the period under the Macedonian dynasty is characterised by a cultural revival in spheres such as philosophy and the arts. There was a conscious effort to restore the brilliance of the period before the Slavic and subsequent Arab invasions, and the Macedonian era has been dubbed the \"Golden Age\" of Byzantium.[86] Although the Empire was significantly smaller than during the reign of Justinian, it had regained significant strength, as the remaining territories were less geographically dispersed and more politically, economically, and culturally integrated.\nTaking advantage of the Empire's weakness after the Revolt of Thomas the Slav in the early 820s, the Arabs re-emerged and captured Crete. They also successfully attacked Sicily, but in 863 general Petronas gained a decisive victory against Umar al-Aqta, the emir of Melitene (Malatya). Under the leadership of emperor Krum, the Bulgarian threat also re-emerged, but in 815–816 Krum's son, Omurtag, signed a peace treaty with Leo V.[87]\n\nIn the 830s Abbasid Caliphate started military excursions culminating with a victory in the Sack of Amorium. The Byzantines then attacked back and sacked Damietta in Egypt. Later the Abbasid Caliphate responded by sending their troops into Anatolia again, sacking and marauding until they were eventually annihilated by the Byzantines in 863.\n\nIn the early years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were successfully repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and convert the Serbs and the principalities of modern-day Herzegovina and Montenegro to Orthodox Christianity.[88]\n\nBy contrast, the Byzantine position in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated so that by 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule,[88] and most of Southern Italy would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years.[89] On the more important eastern front, the Empire rebuilt its defences and went on the offensive. The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.[88]\nUnder Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, the gains in the east against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval weakness of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.[90]\n\nThe death of the Bulgarian tsar Simeon I in 927 severely weakened the Bulgarians, allowing the Byzantines to concentrate on the eastern front.[91] Melitene was permanently recaptured in 934, and in 943 the famous general John Kourkouas continued the offensive in Mesopotamia with some noteworthy victories, culminating in the reconquest of Edessa. Kourkouas was especially celebrated for returning to Constantinople the venerated Mandylion, a relic purportedly imprinted with a portrait of Christ.[92]\n\nThe soldier-emperors Nikephoros II Phokas (reigned 963–969) and John I Tzimiskes (969–976) expanded the empire well into Syria, defeating the emirs of north-west Iraq. The great city of Aleppo was taken by Nikephoros in 962 and the Arabs were decisively expelled from Crete in 963. The recapture of Crete put an end to Arab raids in the Aegean allowing mainland Greece to flourish once again. Cyprus was permanently retaken in 965 and the successes of Nikephoros culminated in 969 with the recapture of Antioch, which he incorporated as a province of the Empire.[93] His successor John Tzimiskes recaptured Damascus, Beirut, Acre, Sidon, Caesarea, and Tiberias, putting Byzantine armies within striking distance of Jerusalem, although the Muslim power centres in Iraq and Egypt were left untouched.[94] After much campaigning in the north, the last Arab threat to Byzantium, the rich province of Sicily, was targeted in 1025 by Basil II, who died before the expedition could be completed. Nevertheless, by that time the Empire stretched from the straits of Messina to the Euphrates and from the Danube to Syria.","privateMemo":"Polygon44_ByzantineEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[14.942191123962402,42.06412887573242,0],[15.126069068908691,41.98874282836914,0],[15.65226936340332,41.87369918823242,0],[15.801652157606252,41.096730971175944,0],[15.970205478091511,40.59107100972016,0],[15.869864463806152,40.10883331298828,0],[15.719588279724121,40.08292007446289,0],[15.635697364807129,40.005943298339844,0],[15.230927467346191,40.22916793823242,0],[15.102334976196289,40.25843048095703,0],[15.19598388671875,40.389190673828125,0],[15.154668807983398,40.568450927734375,0],[14.946981430053711,40.72178649902344,0],[14.53779125213623,40.61057662963867,0],[14.553433418273926,40.65949630737305,0],[14.698254585266113,40.74693298339844,0],[14.573974609375,40.86844253540039,0],[14.443659782409668,40.86991500854492,0],[14.254537582397461,40.78448486328125,0],[14.14554214477539,41.01500701904297,0],[14.056164741516113,41.10792922973633,0],[14.000670433044434,41.210418701171875,0],[13.964171029170481,41.22367039932788,0],[13.702054023742676,41.3188362121582,0],[13.475110054016113,41.33121109008789,0],[13.456232703053857,41.67992546005494,0],[13.591075359442064,41.86870517899843,0],[14.642848079270088,41.89567371027607,0],[14.942191123962402,42.06412887573242,0]],[[15.146061897277832,36.75553512573242,0],[14.82568645477295,36.793113708496094,0],[14.419576644897461,37.0662956237793,0],[14.072068214416504,37.17392349243164,0],[13.215230941772461,37.541866302490234,0],[12.840542793273926,37.598472595214844,0],[12.735699653625488,37.655643463134766,0],[12.657811164855957,37.782981872558594,0],[12.720308303833008,37.93614196777344,0],[12.867989540100098,38.08946990966797,0],[12.986503601074219,38.13434982299805,0],[13.26961612701416,38.08390426635742,0],[13.526139259338379,38.237483978271484,0],[13.831626892089844,38.04677963256836,0],[14.01319408416748,37.9833869934082,0],[14.338136672973633,37.99042510986328,0],[14.969529151916504,38.0745849609375,0],[15.590405464172363,38.22251892089844,0],[15.65735149383545,38.18438720703125,0],[15.676556587219238,38.12702941894531,0],[15.626187324523926,38.06954574584961,0],[15.384696006774902,37.69925308227539,0],[15.315844535827637,37.47600555419922,0],[15.31991195678711,37.303916931152344,0],[15.505010604858398,37.07487106323242,0],[15.424295425415039,37.01734924316406,0],[15.23100757598877,36.762088775634766,0],[15.146061897277832,36.75553512573242,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Dutchy of Benevento","color":"#f1dfe5","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The Duchy of Benevento (after 774, Principality of Benevento) was the southernmost Lombard duchy in the Italian peninsula, centered on Benevento, a city in Southern Italy.

the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.\n\nThe pagan Franks, from whom the ancient name of \"Francie\" was derived, originally settled the north part of Gaul, but under Clovis I conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul. In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (French: La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[40] and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (Rex Christianissimus).\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\n\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French Government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[41] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (Emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor to, modern France.[42]\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of

Caliphate","color":"#7d9ad6","image":"220px-Mosquee_al-akim_le_caire_1.jpg","religion":"","memo":"The Fatimid Caliphate was a Shia Islamic caliphate that spanned a large area of North Africa, from the Red Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. The dynasty of Arab origin[4] ruled across the Mediterranean coast of Africa and ultimately made Egypt the centre of the caliphate. At its height the caliphate included in addition to Egypt varying areas of the Maghreb, Sudan, Sicily, the Levant, and Hijaz.\n\nThe Fatimids (Arabic: الفاطميون‎, translit. al-Fāṭimīyūn) claimed descent from Fatimah, the daughter of Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Fatimid state took shape among the Kutama Berbers, in the West of the North African littoral, in Algeria, in 909 conquering Raqqada, the Aghlabid capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of Mahdia as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to Al-Mansuriya, near Kairouan in Tunisia. In 969 they conquered Egypt and established Cairo as the capital of their caliphate; Egypt became the political, cultural, and religious centre of their empire that developed an indigenous Arabic culture.[5]\n\nThe ruling class belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi'ism, as did the leaders of the dynasty. The existence of the caliphate marked the only time the descendants of Ali and Fatimah were united to any degree (except for the final period of the Rashidun Caliphate under Ali himself from 656 to 661) and the name \"Fatimid\" refers to Fatimah. The different term Fatimite is sometimes used to refer to the caliphate's subjects.\n\nAfter the initial conquests, the caliphate often allowed a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Ismaili sects of Islam, as well as to Jews, Maltese Christians, and Egyptian Coptic Christians.[6] However, its leaders made little headway in persuading the Egyptian population to adopt its religious beliefs.[7]\n\nDuring the late eleventh and twelfth centuries the Fatimid caliphate declined rapidly, and in 1171 Saladin invaded its territory. He founded the Ayyubid dynasty and incorporated the Fatimid state into the Abbasid Caliphate.","privateMemo":"Polygon49_FatimidCaliphate\nファーティマ朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0],[-2.557832956314087,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.711667776107788,36.70711135864258,0],[-2.7661285400390625,36.758121490478516,0],[-4.242921829223633,36.738990783691406,0],[-4.553639888763428,36.50307846069336,0],[-5.013072490692139,36.42656707763672,0],[-5.170563697814941,36.25444793701172,0],[-5.183085918426514,36.126956939697266,0],[-5.2205963134765625,36.088714599609375,0],[-5.253427028656006,36.184329986572266,0],[-5.284269332885742,36.190696716308594,0],[-5.281822681427002,36.082340240478516,0],[-5.456923484802246,36.02497863769531,0],[-5.646350383758545,36.088714599609375,0],[-6.000797271728516,36.299068450927734,0],[-6.1013078689575195,36.471195220947266,0],[-6.085216999053955,36.589149475097656,0],[-6.240361213684082,36.64015579223633,0],[-6.2968220710754395,36.735801696777344,0],[-6.2180495262146,36.80913543701172,0],[-6.428490161895752,37.03872299194336,0],[-6.744290828704834,37.16628646850586,0],[-6.806434631347656,37.18223190307617,0],[-7.024159908294678,37.242828369140625,0],[-7.287839889526367,37.225128173828125,0],[-7.399772644042969,37.17995071411133,0],[-7.632378578186035,37.049224853515625,0],[-7.829974174499512,37.025760650634766,0],[-8.07657527923584,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.337409973144531,37.105552673339844,0],[-8.463396072387695,37.13841247558594,0],[-8.787185668945312,37.006980895996094,0],[-8.812979698181152,37.08677291870117,0],[-8.637847900390625,37.542118072509766,0],[-8.647364616394043,37.927154541015625,0],[-8.729122161865234,37.97881317138672,0],[-8.619329452514648,38.223045349121094,0],[-8.64363956451416,38.40153884887695,0],[-8.585256576538086,38.45295333862305,0],[-8.649988174438477,38.5166130065918,0],[-8.818658828735352,38.47799301147461,0],[-9.032906532287598,38.43442153930664,0],[-9.081494331359863,38.63644027709961,0],[-8.86548900604248,38.65993118286133,0],[-8.738228797912598,38.758888244628906,0],[-8.757163047790527,38.83543395996094,0],[-8.837185859680176,38.93715286254883,0],[-8.972090721130371,38.749202728271484,0],[-9.157973289489746,38.68811798095703,0],[-9.318733215332031,38.7069091796875,0],[-9.345343589782715,38.79148864746094,0],[-9.256098747253418,38.97005081176758,0],[-9.194043159484863,39.24733352661133,0],[-9.2116060256958,39.38364791870117,0],[-9.095605850219727,39.43470764160156,0],[-8.91425895690918,39.661006927490234,0],[-8.711921691894531,40.155120849609375,0],[-8.766005516052246,40.20698928833008,0],[-8.490406036376953,41.0091438293457,0],[-7.566878989190502,40.957553631868194,0],[-7.566878989190502,40.549954323838406,0],[-6.626089244102435,40.63706448542064,0],[-5.365842725829637,40.7537539778533,0],[-3.327846185680688,41.039073493474156,0],[-0.800730475895989,41.93579197113969,0],[0.5443472406023169,42.017311832745655,0],[1.2372660642529585,41.895032040336716,0],[1.6457593122426102,41.196970602202235,0],[1.5149086713790894,41.174224853515625,0],[1.0828657150268555,41.0387077331543,0],[0.937415599822998,40.89192581176758,0],[0.9134458303451538,40.802120208740234,0],[1.0307892560958862,40.7443962097168,0],[0.991220235824585,40.673858642578125,0],[0.7088053822517395,40.6097297668457,0],[0.44159138202667236,40.257171630859375,0],[0.043038755655288696,39.90299606323242,0],[0,39.816410064697266,0],[-0.08085206896066666,39.653743743896484,0],[-0.1911846399307251,39.45143127441406,0],[-0.032239049673080444,39.079376220703125,0],[0,39.029624938964844,0],[0.037968508899211884,38.97103500366211,0],[0.3297797739505768,38.83832550048828,0],[0.37623387575149536,38.75531768798828,0],[0.09665978699922562,38.60847091674805,0],[0,38.56100082397461,0],[-0.23149153590202332,38.44731140136719,0],[-0.36046302318573,38.23183822631836,0],[-0.4610650837421417,38.193546295166016,0],[-0.6686797738075256,37.776771545410156,0],[-0.598899781703949,37.63197708129883,0],[-0.7146084904670715,37.58731460571289,0],[-1.1609041690826416,37.565364837646484,0],[-1.4220486879348755,37.45646286010742,0],[-1.6132160425186157,37.3094482421875,0],[-1.7368113994598389,36.968570709228516,0],[-2.0351336002349854,36.74536895751953,0],[-2.1514337062835693,36.84102249145508,0],[-2.4206676483154297,36.828269958496094,0]],[[-1.5985478266686295,32.44421227623339,0],[-9.421380043029785,30.423072814941406,0],[-9.613378524780273,30.772193908691406,0],[-9.654099464416504,31.07716178894043,0],[-9.609602928161621,31.306032180786133,0],[-9.431659698486328,31.592374801635742,0],[-9.113893508911133,31.980690002441406,0],[-9.01858901977539,32.27322006225586,0],[-9.047102928161621,32.43839645385742,0],[-9.015022277832031,32.59733200073242,0],[-8.436599731445312,33.13870620727539,0],[-8.110751152038574,33.35545349121094,0],[-7.698742389678955,33.50246047973633,0],[-7.1289567947387695,33.71334457397461,0],[-6.800343990325928,33.8919563293457,0],[-6.549310684204102,34.140323638916016,0],[-6.3078083992004395,34.47127151489258,0],[-6.268386138118028,34.547912227893995,0],[-6.098385334

translit. al-Khilāfatu al-ʾUmawiyyah), also spelt Omayyad,[3] was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Muhammad. The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: ٱلأُمَوِيُّون‎, al-ʾUmawiyyūn, or بَنُو أُمَيَّة, Banū ʾUmayya, \"Sons of Umayya\"), hailing from Mecca. The third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656), was a member of the Umayyad clan. The family established dynastic, hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of Syria, who became the fifth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661. After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War[4] and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan. Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital.\n\nThe Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests, incorporating the Transoxiana, Sindh, the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 11,100,000 km2 (4,300,000 sq mi)[1] and 33 million people,[2] making it one of the largest empires in history in both area and proportion of the world's population. The dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rebellion led by the Abbasids in 750. Survivors of the dynasty established themselves in Cordoba in the form of an Emirate and then a Caliphate, lasting until 1031.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphs were considered too secular by some of their Muslim subjects.[5] Christians, who still constituted a majority of the Caliphate's population, and Jews were allowed to practice their own religion but had to pay a head tax (the jizya) from which Muslims were exempt.[6] There was, however, the Muslim-only zakat tax, which was earmarked explicitly for various welfare progammes.[6][7]\n\nMuawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in Syria, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire.[6] Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious accommodation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria. This policy also boosted Muawiya's popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.","privateMemo":"Polygon50_UmayyadCaliphate\nウマイヤ朝","show":true}},{"Position":[[[8.54645293061751,44.237159795955066,0],[8.390024185180664,44.14337158203125,0],[8.293231454878178,44.06780147936362,0],[8.18319034576416,43.98188781738281,0],[7.892784118652344,43.90401840209961,0],[7.756474018096924,43.884422302246094,0],[7.671189164397154,43.82780621322823,0],[7.60078239440918,43.78106689453125,0],[7.558814290422891,43.91848298415894,0],[7.126454165483865,43.832010959171136,0],[7.089394726203377,43.91848298415894,0],[7.163513604764352,43.93083613058577,0],[7.126454165483865,43.992601862719916,0],[7.200573044044841,44.06672074128089,0],[7.175866751191182,44.07907388770772,0],[7.1388073119106945,44.153192766268695,0],[7.089394726203377,44.16554591269553,0],[7.039982140496059,44.12848647341504,0],[6.990569554788742,44.214958498402844,0],[6.990569554788742,44.31378366981748,0],[7.073441982269287,44.36614227294922,0],[6.986581325531006,44.56484603881836,0],[7.128357887268066,44.731990814208984,0],[7.207133769989014,44.736507415771484,0],[7.146267414093018,44.885623931884766,0],[6.868981838226318,44.971492767333984,0],[6.7109832763671875,45.1326789855957,0],[6.484090551288739,45.21556335897602,0],[6.447031112008251,45.31438853039066,0],[6.47173740486191,45.33909482324432,0],[6.422324819154593,45.363801116097974,0],[6.348205940593617,45.33909482324432,0],[6.28644020845947,45.38850740895163,0],[6.237027622752153,45.35144796967114,0],[6.261733915605811,45.24026965182968,0],[6.150555597764347,45.27732909111017,0],[6.138202451337518,45.33909482324432,0],[6.027024133496054,45.41321370180529,0],[5.810746952727775,45.86355029223068,0],[5.560329793230307,45.89301113452449,0],[5.560329793230307,46.06977618828741,0],[5.737094846993225,46.02558492484668,0],[5.737094846993225,46.11396745172814,0],[5.471947266348847,46.33492376893179,0],[5.619251477817945,46.54114966498853,0],[5.849379955577158,46.4736947793447,0],[5.928590321903053,46.4969584015478,0],[5.943320743049964,46.614801770723076,0],[5.829203356395729,46.66605044372007,0],[5.850107907038197,46.86678030509718,0],[5.960679374895596,46.90363746104965,0],[5.997536530848063,47.014208928907046,0],[5.870952360732019,47.12528949141926,0],[5.940534034625836,47.25053650442813,0],[5.982283038962127,47.375783517437,0],[5.99619937374089,47.5288632000034,0],[6.12144638674976,47.61236120867598,0],[6.024032043298417,47.751524556463615,0],[6.163195391086051,47.82110623035743,0],[6.163195391086051,48.002018582481355,0],[6.260609734537394,47.97418591292383,0],[6.302358738873684,48.043767586817644,0],[6.455438421440082,47.97418591292383,0],[6.984416307472996,47.96826172998058,0],[7.473535477108744,47.47914256034483,0],[8.614813539592156,47.47914256034483,0],[8.696333401198114,46.134064843846524,0],[7.7180950619266175,45.4003860893929,0],[7.881134785138534,44.74822719654524,0],[8.49253374718322,44.58518747333332,0],[8.54645293061751,44.237159795955066,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Burgandy","color":"#8784f3","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Burgundy (/ˈbɜːrɡəndi/; French: Bourgogne [buʁɡɔɲ] (About this soundlisten)) is a historical territory and a former administrative region of France.

Initially, the rising Principality of Hungary (\"Western Tourkia\" in medieval Greek sources)[59] was a state consisting of a semi-nomadic people. It accomplished an enormous transformation into a Christian realm during the 10th century.[60]\n\nThis state was well-functioning and the nation's military power allowed the Hungarians to conduct successful fierce campaigns and raids from Constantinople to as far as today's Spain.[60] The Hungarians defeated no fewer than three major East Frankish Imperial Armies between 907 and 910.[61] A later defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories, at least towards the West.\nThe year 972 marked the date when the ruling prince (Hungarian: fejedelem) Géza of the Árpád dynasty officially started to integrate Hungary into the Christian Western Europe.[62] His first-born son, Saint Stephen I, became the first King of Hungary after defeating his pagan uncle Koppány, who also claimed the throne. Under Stephen, Hungary was recognized as a Catholic Apostolic Kingdom.[63] Applying to Pope Sylvester II, Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the Holy Crown of Hungary, currently kept in the Hungarian Parliament) from the papacy.\nBy 1006, Stephen consolidated his power, and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western feudal state. The country switched to using the Latin language, and until as late as 1844, Latin remained the official language of Hungary. Around this time, Hungary began to become a powerful kingdom.[64] Ladislaus I extended Hungary's frontier in Transylvania and invaded Croatia in 1091.[65][66][67][68] The Croatian campaign culminated in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain in 1097 and a personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, ruled by Coloman i.e. Könyves Kálmán.\nThe most powerful and wealthiest king of the Árpád dynasty was Béla III, who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of pure silver a year. This exceeded the income of the French king (estimated at 17 tonnes) and was double the receipts of the English Crown.","privateMemo":"Polygon53_Hungary","show":true}},{"Position":[[[21.197847258504524,44.717051707349526,0],[21.56204811743079,44.789891879134785,0],[22.280402915037094,44.46336697113192,0],[22.541622841439388,44.789891879134785,0],[22.86814774944225,44.65928191593364,0],[22.672232804640533,44.39806198953135,0],[23.129367675844545,44.20214704472963,0],[23.129367675844545,43.81031715512619,0],[23.717112510249702,44.07153708152848,0],[24.435467307856,43.81031715512619,0],[24.827297197459444,44.00623209992791,0],[25.676261958266892,43.745012173525616,0],[26.655836682275485,44.267452026330204,0],[28.157851259088662,44.267452026330204,0],[28.28846122228981,44.593976934333064,0],[28.027241295887514,44.855196860735354,0],[28.222270304962684,45.33245307989232,0],[28.572010836126836,45.34785202991821,0],[28.60582030102903,45.37635804934555,0],[29.268035946298404,45.18172176873822,0],[29.9144287109375,45.275306701660156,0],[29.782625198364258,45.0744743347168,0],[29.66118621826172,44.93212127685547,0],[29.465246200561523,44.91239547729492,0],[29.293413162231445,44.892704010009766,0],[29.12190055847168,44.78272247314453,0],[28.889911651611328,44.50502395629883,0],[28.776777267456055,44.21479415893555,0],[28.733549118041992,43.860443115234375,0],[28.713769912719727,43.760047912597656,0],[28.684202194213867,43.609256744384766,0],[28.649356842041016,43.49333572387695,0],[28.53175926208496,43.454498291015625,0],[28.390722274780273,43.46709060668945,0],[28.23830223083496,43.40887451171875,0],[28.090984344482422,43.08049774169922,0],[28.073572158813477,42.81684875488281,0],[28.039827346801758,42.75249481201172,0],[27.857707977294922,42.70071029663086,0],[27.70561408996582,42.53331756591797,0],[27.698366165161133,42.41787338256836,0],[23.934349871020054,42.192327554330134,0],[23.47082823968559,42.06591256396619,0],[22.695730209350586,40.515262603759766,0],[22.80592918395996,40.41421127319336,0],[22.693281173706055,40.24749755859375,0],[22.6710262298584,40.13545227050781,0],[22.729276657104492,40.081138610839844,0],[22.758792877197266,40.003623962402344,0],[22.898761749267578,39.85145568847656,0],[21.785295034832988,39.70616607717254,0],[20.294492721557617,39.619503021240234,0],[20.232223510742188,39.830753326416016,0],[20.007312774658203,40.033935546875,0],[19.572731018066406,40.277252197265625,0],[19.58388900756836,40.340553283691406,0],[19.687376022338867,40.312862396240234,0],[19.69814682006836,40.4196891784668,0],[19.54288673400879,40.605709075927734,0],[19.730918884277344,40.88286209106445,0],[19.649066925048828,40.981868743896484,0],[19.733613967895508,41.235416412353516,0],[19.620655059814453,41.36222457885742,0],[19.702579498291016,41.540592193603516,0],[19.823047637939453,41.57627487182617,0],[19.81062889099121,41.77851104736328,0],[19.661550521850586,41.81505584716797,0],[19.57137680053711,41.86334228515625,0],[19.542129516601562,41.87899398803711,0],[19.34670066833496,41.94906234741211,0],[19.339208602905273,42.01651382446289,0],[19.113563537597656,42.234764099121094,0],[18.73230743408203,42.36971664428711,0],[18.717252731323242,42.379112243652344,0],[18.452375411987305,42.544410705566406,0],[18.205032348632812,42.711429595947266,0],[17.85004425048828,42.88157272338867,0],[17.79934310913086,42.9058723449707,0],[17.751644134521484,42.93709182739258,0],[17.50773802269127,43.093179461612564,0],[17.278751373291016,43.23971939086914,0],[17.195926666259766,43.33968734741211,0],[16.843477249145508,43.406707763671875,0],[16.915184020996094,43.788299560546875,0],[16.905139923095703,43.86363220214844,0],[17.06876477016965,44.26170862454886,0],[17.01135928500583,44.952026850560145,0],[17.541238385444558,45.15582650457504,0],[18.030357555080304,45.15582650457504,0],[18.15263734748924,44.829747058151206,0],[19.988745613576953,44.953114189181576,0],[20.494334736936892,44.91662837615561,0],[20.51732071448311,44.91806499975225,0],[20.908998301425065,44.65928191593364,0],[21.197847258504524,44.717051707349526,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Bulgar Khanate","color":"#7842d6","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"The First Bulgarian Empire (Old Bulgarian: ц︢рьство бл︢гарское, ts'rstvo bl'garskoe) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in Southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded in 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparuh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating – possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes – the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.\n\nAs the state solidified its position in the Balkans, it entered into a centuries-long interaction, sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, with the Byzantine Empire. Bulgaria emerged as Byzantium's chief antagonist to its north, resulting in several wars. The two powers also enjoyed periods of peace and alliance, most notably during the Second Arab siege of Constantinople, where the Bulgarian army broke the siege and destroyed the Arab army, thus preventing an Arab invasion of Southeastern Europe. Byzantium had a strong cultural influence on Bulgaria, which also led to the eventual adoption of Christianity in 864. After the disintegration of the Avar Khaganate, the country expanded its territory northwest to the Pannonian Plain. Later the Bulgarians confronted the advance of the Pechenegs and Cumans, and achieved a decisive victory over the Magyars, forcing them to establish themselves permanently in Pannonia.\n\nDuring the late 9th and early 10th centuries, Simeon I achieved a string of victories over the Byzantines. Thereafter, he was recognized with the title of Emperor, and proceeded to expand the state to its greatest extent. After the annihilation of the Byzantine army in the battle of Anchialus in 917, the Bulgarians laid siege to Constantinople in 923 and 924. The Byzantines, however, eventually recovered, and in 1014, under Basil II, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Bulgarians at the Battle of Kleidion. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire, and the First Bulgarian Empire had ceased to exist. It was succeeded by the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185.\n\nAfter the adoption of Christianity, Bulgaria became the cultural center of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was further consolidated with the invention of the Glagolitic and Early Cyrillic alphabets shortly after in the capital Preslav, and literature produced in Old Bulgarian soon began spreading north. Old Bulgarian became the lingua franca of much of Eastern Europe and it came to be known as Old Church Slavonic. In 927, the fully independent Bulgarian Patriarchate was officially recognized.\n\nThe ruling Bulgars and other non-Slavic tribes in the empire gradually mixed and adopted the prevailing Slavic language, thus gradually forming the Bulgarian nation from the 7th century to the 9th century. Since the late 9th century, the names Bulgarians and Bulgarian gained prevalence and became permanent designations for the local population, both in literature and in common parlance. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighbouring cultures, while stimulating the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.","privateMemo":"Polygon54_BulgarKhanate\n第一次ブルガリア帝国","show":true}},{"Position":[[[27.59476133572226,47.48567630707035,0],[27.374191479881787,47.98983597756286,0],[24.500772289456577,48.773495756769734,0],[24.3356157342065,48.82809283930362,0],[24.348146829542042,51.31057605582485,0],[24.551946483556936,51.92197501786954,0],[24.37310795902703,54.29721086723772,0],[27.894260809401214,54.89744996648701,0],[28.627939563854834,55.67188865174361,0],[28.75021935626377,56.73164685262106,0],[29.646937833929307,58.07672456911937,0],[30.258336795973996,58.44356394634618,0],[30.95125561962464,58.76964339277001,0],[30.502896380791867,58.93268311598193,0],[31.07353541203357,59.381042354814696,0],[31.31809499685145,60.155481040071294,0],[31.68493437407826,60.40004062488917,0],[32.54089292094082,60.522320417298104,0],[38.57336267978171,58.280524223134265,0],[39.42932122664426,56.97620643743893,0],[39.510841088250224,55.79416844415255,0],[39.10324178022043,54.89744996648701,0],[38.043483579342976,54.00073148882147,0],[37.96196371773702,53.18553287276189,0],[37.26904489408638,53.18553287276189,0],[36.86144558605659,51.96273494867252,0],[36.41308634722382,51.7996952254606,0],[32.33709326692592,50.658417162977194,0],[29.60617790312633,48.946500069252075,0],[27.59476133572226,47.48567630707035,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Kievan Rus","color":"#d15742","image":"220px-Варяги.jpg","religion":"","memo":"Kievan Rus' (Old East Slavic: Рѹ́сь (Rus' ), Рѹ́сьскаѧ землѧ (Rus'skaya zemlya), Latin: Rus(s)ia, Ruscia, Ruzzia, Rut(h)enia[2][3]) was a loose federation[4] of East Slavic and Finnic peoples in Europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century,[5] under the reign of the Varangian Rurik dynasty.[5] The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors,[6] with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it.\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the mid-11th century, it stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south and from the headwaters of the Vistula in the west to the Taman Peninsula in the east,[7][8] uniting the majority of East Slavic tribes.[4]\n\nAccording to Russian historiography, the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what has become known as Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (882–912). He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east,[4] and he moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars.

The bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries. In 1000, Boleslaw the Brave, continuing the policy of his father Mieszko, held a Congress of Gniezno and created the metropolis of Gniezno and the dioceses of Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław.

Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers.\n\nFounded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it controlled much of central and southern Sudan. It exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Alodia, a large, multicultural state, was administrated by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\",[3] prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished.\n\nFrom the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands.

Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day Peru and Chile and lasted from around AD 550 to 1000. Its capital was the monumental city of Tiwanaku, located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73).[2] One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later Inca Empire, but supporting evidence is weak. Tiwanaku was a multi-cultural \"hospitality state\"[3] that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of llama caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800.[2] Outside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \"soft power\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony.","privateMemo":"Polygon65_TiahuanacoEmpire","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-90.73114776611328,19.39847755432129,0],[-90.69257354736328,19.77048683166504,0],[-90.46878051757812,19.963647842407227,0],[-90.51111602783203,20.17827033996582,0],[-90.46945190429688,20.6933650970459,0],[-90.35514068603516,21.008146286010742,0],[-90.07386779785156,21.15838050842285,0],[-90,21.177701950073242,0],[-89.65916442871094,21.266847610473633,0],[-89.34379577636719,21.312023162841797,0],[-88.85442352294922,21.414764404296875,0],[-88.39739990234375,21.581016540527344,0],[-88.13005828857422,21.607013702392578,0],[-87.90572357177734,21.582059860229492,0],[-87.39327239990234,21.50050926208496,0],[-87.16726684570312,21.587627410888672,0],[-86.99691009521484,21.54584503173828,0],[-86.71792602539062,21.317598342895508,0],[-86.69657135009766,21.18415069580078,0],[-86.73223114013672,20.993371963500977,0],[-86.86629486083984,20.821456909179688,0],[-87.1096420288086,20.59845733642578,0],[-87.30448150634766,20.40719985961914,0],[-87.44705200195312,20.20688247680664,0],[-87.45606231689453,19.892108917236328,0],[-87.5703125,19.758384704589844,0],[-87.65454864501953,19.59928321838379,0],[-87.58491516113281,19.529508590698242,0],[-87.43342590332031,19.59163475036621,0],[-87.47854614257812,19.298320770263672,0],[-87.59669494628906,18.760334014892578,0],[-87.64582824707031,18.505956649780273,0],[-87.67343139648438,18.397836685180664,0],[-87.82646942138672,18.638256072998047,0],[-87.9013442993164,18.841520309448242,0],[-87.93401336669922,18.9113712310791,0],[-88.10774230957031,18.758441925048828,0],[-88.1167984008789,18.511371612548828,0],[-88.195556640625,18.326000213623047,0],[-87.92005157470703,18.404062271118164,0],[-87.90827178955078,18.210901260375977,0],[-88.09671020507812,17.652406692504883,0],[-88.01681518554688,17.53126335144043,0],[-88.12334442138672,17.173555374145508,0],[-89.47267039665974,17.480944705175123,0],[-90.57766243905117,17.732672435114527,0],[-91.90335845947266,18.5328311920166,0],[-91.52607727050781,18.432676315307617,0],[-91.4073257446289,18.561504364013672,0],[-91.27533721923828,18.650766372680664,0],[-91.32195281982422,18.76176643371582,0],[-91.49881744384766,18.840456008911133,0],[-91.01603698730469,19.119468688964844,0],[-90.73114776611328,19.39847755432129,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Maya

greatest florescence.[26] During the Early Classic (AD 250-600), cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.[32] At its height during the Late Classic, Tikal had expanded to have a population of well over 100,000.[24] Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.[33] In the southeast, Copán was the most important city.[33] Palenque and Yaxchilán were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region.[33] In the north of the Maya area, Coba was the most important Maya capital.[12] Capital cities of Maya kingdoms could vary considerably in size, apparently related to how many vassal cities were tied to the capital.[34] Overlords of city-states that held sway over a greater number of subordinate lords could command greater quantities of tribute in the form of goods and labour.[5] The most notable forms of tribute pictured on Maya ceramics are cacao, textiles and feathers.[5] During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift of population.[32] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.[32] Major cities in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.","privateMemo":"Polygon66_Mayacity-states","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-99.8123342616011,21.3150882283451,0],[-100.44920818039763,18.92681103285805,0],[-100.2899897006985,18.369546353911073,0],[-99.09585110295498,18.369546353911073,0],[-97.58327554581318,19.48407571180503,0],[-97.34444782626447,20.598605069698987,0],[-98.06093098491058,21.394697468194668,0],[-98.85702338340627,21.633525187743373,0],[-99.8123342616011,21.3150882283451,0]],[[-94.92650604248047,16.31644058227539,0],[-95.29399871826172,16.137680053710938,0],[-95.78904724121094,15.882346153259277,0],[-96.1292724609375,15.767210960388184,0],[-96.5479965209961,15.798094749450684,0],[-96.87395477294922,15.892736434936523,0],[-97.09012603759766,15.981269836425781,0],[-97.67726135253906,16.069000244140625,0],[-97.94198608398438,16.189210891723633,0],[-98.23179626464844,16.379281997680664,0],[-98.65249633789062,16.613582611083984,0],[-99.00556182861328,16.73360252380371,0],[-99.77540588378906,16.909940719604492,0],[-100.20896911621094,17.07429313659668,0],[-100.53375244140625,17.238880157470703,0],[-101.0171127319336,17.434894561767578,0],[-101.28351593017578,17.59325408935547,0],[-101.7889404296875,18.043502807617188,0],[-101.88185119628906,18.075084686279297,0],[-102.1546630859375,18.049083709716797,0],[-102.46453857421875,18.111989974975586,0],[-103.29027557373047,18.370864868164062,0],[-103.54459381103516,18.61188507080078,0],[-103.77124786376953,18.897462844848633,0],[-103.9936294555664,19.074983596801758,0],[-104.46572875976562,19.334619522094727,0],[-104.74424743652344,19.454811096191406,0],[-104.96932220458984,19.67683982849121,0],[-105.3031997680664,20.12112045288086,0],[-105.46676635742188,20.368701934814453,0],[-105.48367309570312,20.419523239135742,0],[-105.41632843017578,20.489591598510742,0],[-105.18915557861328,20.52822494506836,0],[-105.10835266113281,20.604677200317383,0],[-105.0873794555664,20.687362670898438,0],[-100.68803589994634,20.757823549398122,0],[-100.05116198114979,22.588836065938192,0],[-97.50561500596862,21.817978968608834,0],[-97.42445373535156,21.568208694458008,0],[-97.30052947998047,21.206125259399414,0],[-97.01972961425781,20.78080940246582,0],[-96.67778778076172,20.37468147277832,0],[-96.59152221679688,20.171445846557617,0],[-96.37517547607422,19.93670654296875,0],[-96.13700103759766,19.49858283996582,0],[-95.80860137939453,18.94622802734375,0],[-95.64019012451172,18.81309700012207,0],[-95.33551788330078,18.781963348388672,0],[-95.13941955566406,18.788734436035156,0],[-94.87962341308594,18.71936798095703,0],[-94.61280822753906,18.51651954650879,0],[-94.38627624511719,18.28816032409668,0],[-94.0383071899414,18.257122039794922,0],[-93.38419366047071,15.758031782465252,0],[-93.60794830322266,15.937873840332031,0],[-93.84797668457031,16.09627914428711,0],[-93.8717269897461,16.128131866455078,0],[-94.15928649902344,16.241806030273438,0],[-94.63099670410156,16.336145401000977,0],[-94.92650604248047,16.31644058227539,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Mesoamerican

military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.[44] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards.[46] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).\nDuring the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.[47] The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.[48] In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.","privateMemo":"Polygon70_England","show":true}},{"Position":[[[-2.682274341583252,54.185638427734375,0],[-3.0578105449676514,54.15815353393555,0],[-3.275601387023926,54.29157257080078,0],[-3.365569591522217,54.43199920654297,0],[-3.2267420291900635,54.66005325317383,0],[-2.9488613605499268,54.85503005981445,0],[-3.1050379276275635,54.90170669555664,0],[-3.373012065887451,54.94145584106445,0],[-3.7040135860443115,54.806640625,0],[-3.917942523956299,54.7794075012207,0],[-4.418093717708631,56.365323423885414,0],[-4.711539422065521,56.95221483259919,0],[-4.6276977922492675,57.79063113076173,0],[-3.946791887283325,57.85178756713867,0],[-4.0448408126831055,57.65330123901367,0],[-3.9447617530822754,57.57149887084961,0],[-3.5921554565429688,57.558502197265625,0],[-3.1971547603607178,57.59341812133789,0],[-2.8889732360839844,57.593997955322266,0],[-2.6503167152404785,57.5602912902832,0],[-1.9466991424560547,57.588951110839844,0],[-1.7409629821777344,57.41863250732422,0],[-1.9041448831558228,57.22730255126953,0],[-1.9994980096817017,57.081783294677734,0],[-1.9552838802337646,57.03129196166992,0],[-2.2094767093658447,56.73422622680664,0],[-2.3110876083374023,56.68431091308594,0],[-2.4634721279144287,56.487972259521484,0],[-2.776865005493164,56.37055587768555,0],[-2.9487431049346924,56.353790283203125,0],[-2.7457644939422607,56.26997756958008,0],[-2.5171923637390137,56.19516372680664,0],[-2.5691964626312256,56.18828582763672,0],[-2.6916756629943848,56.102474212646484,0],[-2.9661474227905273,56.079078674316406,0],[-3.089843273162842,55.99088668823242,0],[-3.691300868988037,56.00204086303711,0],[-3.509375810623169,55.901668548583984,0],[-3.3735148906707764,55.901668548583984,0],[-3.1521875858306885,55.85966110229492,0],[-2.957798480987549,55.86265563964844,0],[-2.7242376804351807,55.96300506591797,0],[-2.5384676456451416,55.974159240722656,0],[-2.3366823196411133,55.901668548583984,0],[-2.0413472652435303,55.827938079833984,0],[-1.73833167552948,55.57304382324219,0],[-1.8609240083128782,55.317303051182236,0],[-1.6932407486803704,54.353124308295314,0],[-2.682274341583252,54.185638427734375,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Scotland","color":"#f17c7c","image":"NoImage.png","religion":"","memo":"Beginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into three areas: Pictland, a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland;[9]:25–26 the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, which had conquered southeastern Scotland;[9]:18–20 Settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom of Dál Riata in western Scotland the sixth century, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them.[9]:20 These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in subsistence agriculture. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.[9]:26–27\n\nGaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of Gaelic-speaking clerics working as missionaries.[9]:23–24 Operating in the sixth century on the island of Iona, Saint Columba was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.[13]:39 The Vikings began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. Old Norse entirely displaced Gaelic in the Northern Isles.[9]:29–30\n\nIn the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth I) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.[9]:31–32[17] The kingdom of Cináed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.[9]:32–33 From a base in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Spey, the

the 8th to the 10th century, the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings. The looting of the monastery at Lindisfarne in Northeast England in 793 by Norse people has long been regarded as the event which marked the beginning of the Viking Age.[46] This age was characterised by expansion and emigration by Viking seafarers. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. Norwegian Viking explorers first discovered Iceland by accident in the 9th century when heading for the Faroe Islands, and eventually came across Vinland, known today as Newfoundland, in Canada. The Vikings from Norway were most active in the northern and western British Isles and eastern North America isles.[47]\n\nAccording to tradition, Harald Fairhair unified them into one in 872 after the Battle of Hafrsfjord in Stavanger, thus becoming the first king of a united Norway.[48] Harald's realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state. Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and parts of Britain and Ireland. The modern-day Irish cities of Dublin, Limerick and Waterford were founded by Norwegian settlers.[49]\n\nNorse traditions were replaced slowly by Christian ones in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.[50] This is largely attributed to the missionary kings Olav Tryggvasson and St. Olav. Haakon the Good was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. Born sometime in between 963–969, Olav Tryggvasson set off raiding in England with 390 ships. He attacked London during this raiding. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olav landed in Moster. There he built a church which became the first Christian church ever built in Norway. From Moster, Olav sailed north to Trondheim where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.[51]\n\nFeudalism never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The Hanseatic League forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real burgher class existed in Norway.","privateMemo":"Polygon72_Norway","show":true}},{"Position":[[[12.080286026000977,57.34217834472656,0],[12.08477783203125,57.525936126708984,0],[11.969748497009277,57.68965148925781,0],[11.940039981093523,57.71518069247779,0],[12.69155925029689,58.57989147544779,0],[12.626436233520508,60.05575180053711,0],[12.639524459838867,60.29507064819336,0],[12.751622200012207,60.450843811035156,0],[12.63469409942627,60.642818450927734,0],[12.377702713012695,60.9733772277832,0],[12.801045417785645,61.04559326171875,0],[12.995400428771973,61.346920013427734,0],[13.358563367959658,62.04119910351319,0],[14.547384405819331,62.96510054683754,0],[16.39673998724291,62.77263688670082,0],[18.07183265686035,62.80559158325195,0],[18.13991928100586,62.56497573852539,0],[17.921775817871094,62.37370681762695,0],[17.49390411376953,62.45769500732422,0],[17.591026306152344,62.21773910522461,0],[17.700435638427734,62.105072021484375,0],[17.59063720703125,61.67540740966797,0],[17.36630630493164,61.64687728881836,0],[17.268840789794922,61.55535125732422,0],[17.353853225708008,61.21467971801758,0],[17.349872589111328,60.96979904174805,0],[17.521291732788086,60.770042419433594,0],[17.392162322998047,60.69126510620117,0],[17.80862808227539,60.654510498046875,0],[17.910120010375977,60.570552825927734,0],[18.13441276550293,60.60728073120117,0],[18.428050994873047,60.33993911743164,0],[18.620529174804688,60.1985969543457,0],[19.007749557495117,60.125370025634766,0],[19.09673500061035,59.94266128540039,0],[19.24098777770996,59.88021469116211,0],[19.247215270996094,59.72939682006836,0],[19.071556091308594,59.72939682006836,0],[18.842914581298828,59.583900451660156,0],[18.45508575439453,59.448909759521484,0],[18.233747482299805,59.37625503540039,0],[17.998947143554688,59.381446838378906,0],[17.933616638183594,59.43333435058594,0],[17.57164764404297,59.48523712158203,0],[17.274261474609375,59.5631217956543,0],[16.98920249938965,59.59428787231445,0],[16.927753448486328,59.547542572021484,0],[16.726871490478516,59.5994873046875,0],[16.61124038696289,59.46446990966797,0],[16.980138778686523,59.495628356933594,0],[17.20349884033203,59.37625503540039,0],[17.46944236755371,59.355506896972656,0],[17.561786651611328,59.262149810791016,0],[17.77858543395996,59.23104476928711,0],[17.788076400756836,59.2880859375,0],[18.06539535522461,59.25696563720703,0],[18.181299209594727,59.345123291015625,0],[18.31504249572754,59.33994674682617,0],[18.53183364868164,59.38663864135742,0],[18.633224487304688,59.350318908691406,0],[18.645034790039062,59.417762756347656,0],[18.719133377075195,59.417762756347656,0],[18.814990997314453,59.350318908691406,0],[18.80185890197754,59.31401443481445,0],[18.477035522460938,59.30363845825195,0],[18.575624465942383,59.174041748046875,0],[18.219331741333008,59.05488204956055,0],[18.143800735473633,58.92546081542969,0],[17.970129013061523,58.88924026489258,0],[17.930086135864258,58.930633544921875,0],[17.948863983154297,59.00310134887695,0],[17.942771911621094,59.12739562988281,0],[17.826845169067383,59.117042541503906,0],[17.785852432250977,58.90993881225586,0],[17.560338973999023,58.75994110107422,0],[17.449052810668945,58.73408889770508,0],[17.286663055419922,58.765106201171875,0],[17.284395217895508,58.666900634765625,0],[16.646530151367188,58.65139389038086,0],[16.71685791015625,58.44508743286133,0],[16.947708129882812,58.328922271728516,0],[16.977209091186523,58.054874420166016,0],[16.92824935913086,57.90629577636719,0],[16.801427841186523,57.883426666259766,0],[16.66319465637207,57.91217803955078,0],[16.680194854736328,57.71910095214844,0],[16.810869216918945,57.68278503417969,0],[16.75414276123047,57.5621223449707,0],[16.862342834472656,57.459922790527344,0],[16.69782257080078,57.295894622802734,0],[16.598188400268555,57.09127426147461,0],[16.579837799072266,56.839393615722656,0],[16.26681440159225,56.41321126506121,0],[15.630657126335688,56.78271286989617,0],[14.688644062853605,56.69707531867053,0],[14.37907588781496,56.829774947596746,0],[13.63611226772221,56.54084465089401,0],[13.429733484363112,57.118705244299484,0],[13.099527430988557,56.99487797428402,0],[12.934424404301279,57.44891129767404,0],[12.728045620942181,57.40763554100222,0],[12.521666837583084,57.69656583770495,0],[12.080286026000977,57.34217834472656,0]]],"Attribute":{"name":"Sweden","color":"#3ee182","image":"220px-Bildsten_med_skepp_800-1099_Tjängvide,_Gotland.jpg","religion":"","memo":"It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the 6th century. Götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of Östergötland (East Gothia) and Västergötland (West Gothia). The island of Gotland was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). Småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces (Scania, Blekinge and Halland). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohuslän. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland.\nDuring the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, Ystad in the Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.[23] In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.","privateMemo":"Polygon73_Sweden","show":true}},{"Position":[[[8.387150764465332,56.815452575683594,0],[8.56253719329834,57.039710998535156,0],[8.737699508666992,57.157554626464844,0],[8.864964485168457,57.121070861816406,0],[9.163522720336914,57.14913558959961,0],[9.506084442138672,57.18281555175781,0],[9.652349472045898,57.24458694458008,0],[10.052923202514648,57.598758697509766,0],[10.493185043334961,57.6888313293457,0],[10.59380054473877,57.67756652832031,0],[10.683123588562012,57.77610397338867,0],[10.761719703674316,57.76202392578125,0],[10.604846000671387,57.522850036621094,0],[10.65439224243164,57.47500228881836,0],[10.66650104522705,57.25863265991211,0],[10.536953926086426,57.18843460083008,0],[10.460216522216797,57.022884368896484,0],[9.70666790008545,56.992034912109375,0],[9.53742504119873,57.039710998535156,0],[9.344904899597168,57.02568435668945,0],[9.282211303710938,57.053733825683594,0],[9.174544334411621,57.017269134521484,0],[9.050688743591309,57.00325393676758,0],[8.981745719909668,56.815452575683594,0],[8.869645118713379,56.717430114746094,0],[8.710784912109375,56.66423797607422,0],[8.674592018127441,56.613861083984375,0],[8.571892738342285,56.68383026123047,0],[8.387150764465332,56.815452575683594,0]],[[8.819761276245117,54.904335021972656,0],[8.848738670349121,55.08601760864258,0],[8.763223648071289,55.37309646606445,0],[8.685002326965332,55.3662109375,0],[8.522634506225586,55.498046875,0],[8.417702674865723,55.41556930541992,0],[8.23823070526123,55.49288558959961,0],[8.328737258911133,55.652801513671875,0],[8.523694038391113,55.784706115722656,0],[8.520638465881348,55.86588668823242,0],[8.32027816772461,56.109230041503906,0],[8.328143119812012,56.224449157714844,0],[8.387093544006348,56.44843673706055,0],[8.512494087219238,56.496177673339844,0],[8.655900001525879,56.42857360839844,0],[8.878552436828613,56.374717712402344,0],[9.072242736816406,56.63308334350586,0],[9.206365585327148,56.674129486083984,0],[9.339516639709473,56.47739028930664,0],[9.515538215637207,56.49809646606445,0],[9.525726318359375,56.73590850830078,0],[9.573810577392578,56.89923858642578,0],[10.038287162780762,56.90691375732422,0],[10.419852256774902,56.8668212890625,0],[10.433347702026367,56.62209701538086,0],[10.517424583435059,56.486446380615234,0],[11.029488563537598,56.460262298583984,0],[11.092339515686035,56.385719299316406,0],[10.95433235168457,56.114253997802734,0],[10.699756622314453,56.05059814453125,0],[10.646143913269043,56.16787338256836,0],[10.497110366821289,56.1540412902832,0],[10.378820419311523,56.09284591674805,0],[10.433542251586914,55.967864990234375,0],[10.350810050964355,55.781864166259766,0],[10.210783958435059,55.74736022949219,0],[10.179410934448242,55.63732147216797,0],[9.893736839294434,55.6218376159668,0],[9.964405059814453,55.51866912841797,0],[9.833847045898438,55.47637939453125,0],[9.747529029846191,55.36823654174805,0],[9.72022533416748,55.24003982543945,0],[9.721485137939453,55.145652770996094,0],[9.62468433380127,54.99345397949219,0],[9.69964599609375,54.955265045166016,0],[9.813926696777344,54.89701461791992,0],[10.068107604980469,54.743263244628906,0],[10.190351486206055,54.60941696166992,0],[10.181674003601074,54.507118225097656,0],[10.068471908569336,54.42837142944336,0],[10.26859188079834,54.45086669921875,0],[10.345392227172852,54.35372543334961,0],[10.088466578007942,54.27107513027822,0],[10.030317297847892,54.292881110338236,0],[9.943093377607816,54.292881110338236,0],[9.877675437427762,54.205657190098165,0],[9.652346976807568,54.205657190098165,0],[9.645078316787561,54.26380647025822,0],[9.499705116387435,54.26380647025822,0],[9.463361816287405,54.32195575041826,0],[9.419749856167368,54.30741843037825,0],[9.368869236027324,54.336493070458275,0],[9.339794595947298,54.31468709039826,0],[9.25983933572723,54.3655677105383,0],[9.165346755467148,54.292881110338236,0],[9.087676048278809,54.246421813964844,0],[8.78438949584961,54.21065902709961,0],[8.757610321044922,54.29241180419922,0],[9.056086540222168,54.3486213684082,0],[9.154265403747559,54.43552780151367,0],[8.945732116699219,54.62477493286133,0],[8.799650192260742,54.778324127197266,0],[8.819761276245117,54.904335021972656,0]],[[12.080286026000977,57.34217834472656,0],[12.521666837583084,57.69656583770495,0],[12.728045620942181,57.40763554100222,0],[12.934424404301279,57.44891129767404,0],[13.099527430988557,56.99487797428402,0],[13.429733484363112,57.118705244299484,0],[13.63611226772221,56.54084465089401,0],[14.37907588781496,56.829774947596746,0],[14.688644062853605,56.69707531867053,0],[15.630657126335688,56.78271286989617,0],[16.26681440159225,56.41321126506121,0],[16.235109329223633,56.37004470825195,0],[15.974205017089844,56.0501823425293,0],[15.899892807006836,56.07793426513672,0],[15.700704574584961,56.1842155456543,0],[15.42446517944336,56.09733581542969,0],[14.85655689239502,56.13758850097656,0],[14.808894157409668,55.99775695800781,0],[14.695491790771484,56.035011291503906,0],[14.462589263916016,55.9

the 8th to the 10th century the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings.

After the Carolingian king Louis the Child died without issue in 911, East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the realm but instead elected one of the dukes, Conrad of Franconia, as Rex Francorum Orientalium.[38]:117 On his deathbed, Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival, Henry the Fowler of Saxony (r. 919–36), who was elected king at the Diet of Fritzlar in 919.[38]:118 Henry reached a truce with the raiding Magyars, and in 933 he won a first victory against them in the Battle of Riade.[38]:121\n\nHenry died in 936, but his descendants, the Liudolfing (or Ottonian) dynasty, would continue to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century. Upon Henry the Fowler's death, Otto, his son and designated successor,[39] was elected King in Aachen in 936.[40]:706 He overcame a series of revolts from a younger brother and from several dukes. After that, the king managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in administrative affairs.\nIn 951, Otto came to the aid of Adelaide, the widowed queen of Italy, defeating her enemies, marrying her, and taking control over Italy.[41]:214–15 In 955, Otto won a decisive victory over the Magyars in the Battle of Lechfeld.[40]:707 In 962, Otto was crowned Emperor by Pope John XII,[40]:707 thus intertwining the affairs of the German kingdom with those of Italy and the Papacy. Otto's coronation as Emperor marked the German kings as successors to the Empire of Charlemagne, which through the concept of translatio imperii, also made them consider themselves as successors to Ancient Rome.\n\nThe kingdom had no permanent capital city.[42] Kings traveled between residences (called Kaiserpfalz) to discharge affairs. However, each king preferred certain places; in Otto's case, this was the city of Magdeburg. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but Kings often ensured their own sons were elected during their lifetimes, enabling them to keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century.","privateMemo":"Polygon75_Hamburg\nHoly Roman Empire","show":true}}]
